2011-12-30T20:42:02+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,TCS pips Reliance to become India's most valuable firm,"Top software exporter Tata Consultancy Services surpassed Reliance Industries on the last trading day of the year to become the country's most-valuable firm, capping a gloomy year for shareholders of the energy major controlled by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani.","Top software exporter Tata Consultancy Services surpassed Reliance Industries on the last trading day of the year to become the country's most-valuable firm, capping a gloomy year for shareholders of the energy major controlled by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani. Reliance, for long the darling of Indian investors, was briefly knocked off its four-year long perch as the country's most-valuable company in August -- first by state-run Coal India and then by Oil &amp;amp;amp; Natural Gas Corp -- before regaining it. TCS, part of the salt-to-software Tata conglomerate, is the first private-sector company to overtake Reliance in market value. Shares in Reliance, which owns the world's largest refinery complex, fell 2.7% on Friday to their lowest level since March 2009. The stock lost 34.5% in 2011, underperforming a 24.6% fall in the benchmark index. At Friday's close, Reliance was valued at about USD 42.7 billion, while TCS commanded a market value of USD 42.8 billion, despite its shares closing 0.4% lower. &amp;quot;This leadership game is becoming like a musical chair,&amp;quot; said Jagannadham Thunuguntla, head of research at SMC Global securities in New Delhi. &amp;quot;If the underperformance in Reliance shares continues, it will become difficult for them to regain the top position again.&amp;quot; Reliance's growth outlook has been marred by falling gas output from its huge KG D6 gas fields, off India's east coast, which has drawn criticism from the country's upstream regulator, investors and analysts. A USD 7.2 billion deal to sell a 30% stake in 23 oil and gas blocks to BP Plc struck earlier this year failed to impress shareholders, who are also looking for more clarity on the company's move to enter new areas such as retail and telecoms. &amp;quot;KG D6 has sort of become a drag,&amp;quot; Thunuguntla said. &amp;quot;And also, they have somehow got into a long-gestation trap in all their businesses -- be it oil and gas, retail or telecom.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;They are sitting on a huge cash pile and need to deploy it at the right place. Holding cash is again not good,&amp;quot; he said. TCS, which competes with companies such as Infosys Ltd and Wipro in providing software services to western clients, saw its share price jump nearly 12% in the December quarter, compared with a 6% drop in the benchmark index. TCS has shed 0.4% on the year. Global technology spending outlook remains uncertain with no easy fix seen to the euro zone sovereign debt crisis and concerns about the US economy, but a sharp fall in the Indian rupee helps these exporters who get most of their revenues in foreign currencies while bulk of their spends are in rupee.","Business, Coal India, most-valuable firm, Mukesh Ambani, Oil & Natural Gas Corp, Reliance Industries, Tata Consultancy Services","Business, Coal India, most-valuable firm, Mukesh Ambani, Oil &amp;amp;amp; Natural Gas Corp, Reliance Industries, Tata Consultancy Services",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tcs-pips-reliance-to-become-indias-most-valuable-firm_642158.html

This year's list of the country's 500 largest corporations, compiled by the global business magazine Fortune's Indian edition, features as many as 57 new entities.  All the 500 firms together recorded a collective turnover of Rs 45,79,911.38 crore in the latest financial year. Indian Oil Corp (IOC) was the biggest with annual revenue of Rs 3,23,113.12 crore, followed by Reliance Industries (RIL) with a full-year revenue of Rs 2,72,923.36 crore. Both IOC and RIL have retained their top-two ranks from the previous year, Fortune India said.  In this year's list, the two are followed by Bharat Petroleum (Rs 1,56,580.12 crore) at the third and State Bank of India (Rs 1,47,843.92 crore) at the fourth place.

The magazine said that the total sales of the country's 500 top corporations have grown by 21.5% from the last year, while their median growth has been even higher at about 25%.  &amp;quot;The good news, however, is that many of the Fortune India 500 companies are now beginning to shape the world's opinion of India for the better.

We got Petroleum Ministry in-principle approval yesterday for disinvestment in OIL. We have to work out the details,&amp;quot; Disinvestment Secretary Mohammad Haleem Khan said today. The total shares that the government will sell in OIL is yet to be decided, he said, adding, &amp;quot;the process of inter-ministerial consultation is on.&amp;quot; The government owns 78.43% in OIL. OIL had in September 2009 hit the market with an initial public offer and had mopped up over Rs 4,900 crore.  As part of the IPO, the government offloaded its 10% equity, while company issued 11% fresh equity. Khan further said that the government has identified GAIL (India) Ltd as a possible candidate for stake sale. He, however, did not mention if the OIL and GAIL issue would be done in the current fiscal. The government aims to raise Rs 40,000 crore through the sale of stakes in state-run companies in the current fiscal, but it has so far been able to mop up only Rs 1,145 crore due to weak market conditions. Khan said the government would stick to the public offer route for stake sale in ONGC and BHEL, in which it plans to divest 5% stake. The disinvestment of BHEL is held up for want of adequate independent directors on board, while in case of ONGC some directors are retiring, an official in the finance ministry said. Clause 49 of the Sebi regulations mandates that half of the company's board should comprise independent directors. BHEL, which has already filed draft papers with Sebi for a Rs 4,000 crore follow on offer last month, needs two more independent directors on board. Besides, through disinvestment in blue-chip oil company ONGC the government aims to mop up about Rs 12,000 crore.  The official further said that the government is looking at other options, including private placement and buy back, to achieve the disinvestment target for the current fiscal. Under the buyback mode, the government can raise money by selling its equity in the company to the concerned PSU itself. The ministry is also considering asking cash rich PSUs to buyback shares.","BHEL, Business, Disinvestment Ministry, GAIL, Mohammad Haleem, Oil India Ltd, ONGC","BHEL, Business, Disinvestment Ministry, GAIL, Mohammad Haleem, Oil India Ltd, ONGC",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/govt-going-aheadoil-disinvestment-dod-secy_620333.html

ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Sudhir Vasudeva and other members of the Board of Directors inspected the Ankleshwar oilfield yesterday, they said. ONGC struck oil at `Vasundhara', the first well of the company at Ankleshwar, in May 1960. In mid 1980s, another oil and gas field was discovered by the company in Gandhar.  The oilfields at Ankleshwar and Gandhar account for 25 per cent of total onshore production of the country. However, production from the existing oil and gas wells had been declining over the years, the sources said. The company now wants to spend this amount (Rs 2,200 crore), which has been approved by the Board of Directors, for increasing output from the two oilfields, they said. &amp;quot;ONGC is deploying latest technologies in collaboration with global players to achieve its goal.&amp;quot;  The public sector undertaking is also focusing on the east cost. &amp;quot;Efforts are being made to step up production from Andhra Pradesh on east coast.

2011-09-14T19:55:02+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,Cairn shareholders okay conditions for Vedanta stake buy,"Cairn India shareholders have approved the government of India (GoI) pre-conditions with majority vote of 97.29%, reports Nayantara Rai of CNBC-TV18.","The Cairn-Vedanta deal is one step closer to becoming a reality. Cairn India shareholders have approved the government of India (GoI) pre-conditions with majority vote of 97.29%, reports Nayantara Rai of CNBC-TV18. Majority of Cairn India shareholders today voted in favour of company reversing its earlier stand and conceding to pay royalty and cess on its mainstay Rajasthan oilfields. Cairn India board, however, added a caveat that it will agree to making royalty cost recoverable and pay Rs 2,500 per tonne cess on the Rajasthan oil only after partner Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) issues a no-objection certificate to its parent, Cairn Energy's proposal to sell controlling staketo mining group Vedanta Resources. Also Read:&amp;amp;nbsp; CAG wants Cairn field cost increase to be audited as well The company in a letter to the stock exchanges said &amp;quot;an overwhelming majority of 97.29%&amp;quot; of its shareholders had voted for accepting the two conditions that the government had set for approving Cairn Energy's sale of 40% stake in its Indian unit to Vedanta. Cairn Energy, which had summoned the shareholder vote since Cairn India board had previously taken a position that the conditions were unacceptable to it, and Vedanta Group voted for acceptance of the riders. Cairn Energy held 52.11% stake in Cairn India and Vedanta Group another 28.5%. The letter said Cairn India board, chaired by its Chairman Bill Gammell, &amp;quot;has accepted the mandate&amp;quot; and will obtain consent from partner ONGC. &amp;quot;...subject to the receipt of the foregoing approval from ONGC, the company (Cairn India) shall communicate an acceptance in respect of RJ-ON-90/1 (Rajasthan) block, that the royalty paid by ONGC is recoverable by ONGC as contract cost; and the company's subsidiaries shall withdraw thearbitration claim relating to the dispute raised by them on payment of cess,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;The acceptance of royalty as being cost recoverable and the withdrawal of the arbitration pertaining to cess will be concomitant with transfer of control of Cairn India Ltd,&amp;quot; the letter added. Cairn India currently does not pay any royalty on its 70 per cent interest in the Rajasthan fields. Royalty, as per the contract, is paid by state-owned ONGC, which got a 30 per cent stake in the 6.5 billion barrel field for free.  But as per the Production Sharing Contract, ONGC had much before the USD 9.6 billion Cairn-Vedanta deal was announced in August last year, demanded that like all other taxes the royalty should be added to project cost which is first deducted from revenues earned from oil sales before profits split between partners. Cairn had opposed this as it would lower its profitability and had also initiated arbitration against government on its liability to pay oil cess on its share. Itbelieved the cess, like royalty, was a liability of ONGC. &amp;quot;The acceptance of royalty as being cost recoverable and the withdrawal of the arbitration pertaining to cess will be concomitant with transfer of control of Cairn India Ltd,&amp;quot; the letter said. Cairn said it is producing 125,000 barrels of oil per day from Mangala oilfield in the Rajasthan block. &amp;quot;Our understanding of the resource base in the Rajasthan block supports a vision to produce 240,000 bpd, equivalent to a contribution of about 30% of India's current crude production, subject to further investment, partner andregulatory approvals, including exploration rights in the development areas.&amp;quot; The board of Cairn India had in February opposed changes in the Rajasthan contract making it liable to pay royalty and a Rs 2,500 per tonne cess. Sources said Cairn Energy Chairman Bill Gammell arrived here yesterday morning to chair the Cairn India board meeting. Gammell had last month skipped a Cairn India shareholders' meet. Cairn India will now formally write to its partner Oil and Natural Gas Corp, which owns stake in 8 out of the company's 10 properties in India, for consent for the Vedanta transaction. The ONGC board may consider waiving its preemption or right of first refusal (ROFR) and give Cairn a no-objection certificate to conclude the deal at its board meeting on September 27. Cairn Energy, which is selling a 40% stake in its Indian unit to Vedanta, had previously said it would rather call off the deal than force Cairn India to accept the government's conditions. Cairn India had on July 26 stated that its April-June quarter net profit would halve to Rs 1,435 crore if it was asked to share royalty on the Rajasthan crude oil. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on June 27 gave consent to the Cairn-Vedanta deal, subject to Cairn or its successor agreeing to charge or deduct the royalty paid by ONGC from revenues earned from the sale of oil before the profits are split between partners. Cairn Energy's request for the twin government conditions to be voted on by shareholders is being done through a postal ballot. After postal ballots were counted, Cairn India's board of directors met. Last August, Vedanta proposed buying a 51-60% stake in oil and gas explorer Cairn India for up to USD 9.6 billion in cash, but the deal has been delayed awaiting government and regulatory approvals. A Group of Ministers headed by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee had recommended to the Cabinet that the deal should be approved if Cairn or its successor agreed to royalty being added to the project cost and recovered from oil sales, as well as agreeing to pay its share of oil cess. Days before the CCEA accepted the GoM recommendation and gave conditional approval, Cairn Energy lowered the price it was demanding from Vedanta to make up for the reduced profitability due to acceptance of the preconditions. It also removed a non-compete provision from the deal and the related non-compete fee of Rs 50 per share. Vedanta's total payment for a 40% stake in Cairn India, at the reduced price of Rs 355 per share, will now be USD 6.02 billion, instead of the earlier announced USD 6.84 billion.

The board of Cairn India, which had in February opposed changes in the Rajasthan contract making it liable to pay royalty and a Rs 2,500 per tonne cess, will meet tomorrow, after&amp;amp;nbsp;which the results of a shareholder vote called by Cairn Energy on the twin riders will be out, sources privy to the development said. Cairn Energy, which owns a 52.11% stake in Cairn India, has voted to accept the two government conditions. Vedanta, which has already bought a 10% stake in the company from Cairn Energy and another 18.5% fromPetronas of Malaysia and other minority shareholders, has also voted for acceptance of the conditions. Sources said Cairn Energy Chairman Bill Gammell arrived here today to chair the Cairn India board meeting. Gammell had last month skipped a Cairn India shareholders' meet, apparently to escape uncomfortable questions on the change of position. After Cairn India's board agrees to make royalty cost-recoverable and pay cess on oil produced from the Rajasthan fields, it will write to its partner, state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), for consent for the Vedantatransaction. The ONGC board may consider waiving its preemption or right of first refusal (ROFR) and give Cairn a no-objection certificate to conclude the deal at its board meeting on September 27. Cairn Energy, which is selling a 40% stake in its Indian unit to Vedanta, had previously said it would rather call off the deal than force Cairn India to accept the government's conditions. Minority shareholders at Cairn India's AGM in Mumbai last month had booed Cairn Energy for changing tack on the issue of royalty and cess to get USD 6.02 billion from the stake sale to Vedanta. Cairn India had on July 26 stated that its April-June quarter net profit would halve to Rs 1,435 crore if it was asked to share royalty on the Rajasthan crude oil. The company currently does not pay any royalty on its 70% interest in the Rajasthan fields. Royalty, as per the contract, is paid by state-owned ONGC, which got a 30% stake in the 6.5 billion barrel field for free. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on June 27 gave consent to the Cairn-Vedanta deal, subject to Cairn or its successor agreeing to charge or deduct the royalty paid by ONGC from revenues earned from the sale of oil before the profits are split between partners. Also, Cairn India must pay a Rs 2,500 per tonne cess on its 70% share of oil production. Till recently, Cairn had maintained that cess, like royalty, is a liability of ONGC and had initiated arbitration against the government over being forced to pay cess. Cairn Energy's request for the twin government conditions to be voted on by shareholders is being done through a postal ballot. Sources said the results of the postal ballot will be announced tomorrow afternoon, after which Cairn India's board of directors will meet. Cairn Energy is selling a 40% stake in Cairn India in two tranches. The first tranche of 10% was completed in July and the second of 30% will be done after final government approval for the deal. Since the Cairn-Vedanta deal was announced in August last year, Cairn India has been opposed to making royalty payments recoverable from the sale of oil and the company being made liable to pay a Rs 2,500 per tonne cess, as this was not in line with the Production Sharing Contract (PSC). A change in the contract was neither in the interest of the company, nor its minority shareholders, it has maintained. Last August, Vedanta proposed buying a 51-60% stake in oil and gas explorer Cairn India for up to USD 9.6 billion in cash, but the deal has been delayed awaiting government and regulatory approvals.

He said ONGC has also drawn up plans to begin production from its G-1 marginal field in the KG Basin from July 2012. The company has asked the Petroleum Ministry to identify gas users and approve a price of USD 4.75 per million British thermal units. About 0.19 million standard cubic metres per day of gas is being produced, he said, adding that output would go up to 1.52 mmscmd from July next year (subsequent to the G-1 field coming onstream) and to 1.72 mmscmd in 2013-14. ONGC cited the Oil Ministry's gas pricing order, which had fixed a base price of USD 4.50 per mmBtu for gas from the KG Basin and given an additional USD 0.25 per mmBtu if the gas was coming from offshore fields, to demand a gas price of USD 4.75 per mmBtu. The official said the output will begin to dip from 2013-14 to 1.59 mmscmd and taper to 0.029 mmscmd by 2022-23. The field will also produce 9,400 barrels of crude oil per day. ONGC envisages the production of 0.982 million tonnes of sweet or low-sulfur crude and 5.92 billion cubic metres of gas over a period of 15 years from G-1 and GS-15. G-1 is located 28 kilometres off the Amalapuram coast, inwater depths ranging from 135-500 metres, while GS-15 is located 5 km from the coast in the KG Basin. G-1 and GS-15 are two marginal fields that were awarded to ONGC on a nomination basis. The two acreages are being developed together at an estimated cost of Rs 1,200 crore.  According to the gas production profile, G-1 and GS-15 will produce 1.52 mmscmd in 2011-12, 1.72 mmscmd in 2012-13, 1.59 mmscmd in 2013-14, 1.36 mmscmd in 2014-15, 0.99 mmscmd in 2015-16, 0.87 mmscmd in 2016-17, 0.87 mmscmd in 2018-19, 1.11 mmscmd in 2019-20, 0.95 mmscmd in 2020-21, 0.71 mmscmd in 2021-22 and 0.029 mmscmd in 2022-23.","Business, Oil and Natural Gas Corp, oil ministry, Petroleum Ministry, World Energy Policy Summit","Business, Oil and Natural Gas Corp, oil ministry, Petroleum Ministry, World Energy Policy Summit",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-starts-oil-gas-productiongs-15-field_583336.html

The Indian government has charged ONGC with securing energy supplies overseas to fuel the country's fast-growing economy. India, the world's fourth-biggest oil importer, buys in nearly 80% of its oil needs as expanding refining capacity has outpaced growth in local oil output. ONGC's local oil output has been almost stagnant in the last five years. &amp;quot;We need to spread our risk. We need to diversify into politically less risky countries like north America ... USA, Canada. We would like to readjust our portfolio,&amp;quot; Joeman Thomas told reporters. He said his firm wants to acquire producing assets in two to three years. &amp;quot;Our short-term focus is to acquire stakes in producing properties. Our focus is more on growing production&amp;quot;. ONGC Videsh aims to source 400,000 barrels per day of crude from its assets overseas by 2020. It expects output from such assets to reach 175,000 bpd in the current financial year through to March 2012, he said. The social and political upheaval in the Middle East and parts of Africa has raised the risk profile of some of the hydrocarbon-rich countries. US and Canadian companies such as Marathon, ConocoPhillips, Hess, Occidental and Suncor pulled out of Libya at the start of the year and have had little direct involvement there since then. Thomas said a force majeure was still continuing at its exploration block in Libya and it was still negotiating with Iran to get development rights for the Farsi block. India has recently managed to find a solution to a payment issue with Iran after the Reserve Bank of India scrapped a long-standing clearing house mechanism to pay for Iran oil imports under US pressure. ONGC Videsh has a stake in 33 projects in 14 countries including Vietnam, Sudan, Colombia, Russia, Syria, Venezuela, Brazil, Myanmar, Libya and Kazakhstan.","Business, ConocoPhillips, Hess, Libya, marathon, Occidental, ONGC, ONGC Videsh Ltd, Suncor","Business, ConocoPhillips, Hess, Libya, marathon, Occidental, ONGC, ONGC Videsh Ltd, Suncor",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-seeks-producing-assetspolitically-stable-countries_581490.html

The fields under development are: C-Series, B-22 cluster, B-193 cluster, B-46 cluster, North Tapti gas field, Cluster-7, BHE &amp;amp;amp; BH-35, WO-16 cluster, G-1 &amp;amp;amp; GS-15 and SB-14. &amp;quot;These fields are expected to be on stream by 2013-14.&amp;quot; ONGC output has dipped to about 24 million tonnes (MT) and the marginal fields will help it reach past glory of 28 MT. He said production from Krishna Godavari basin GS-15 field will commence by mid-September. ONGC will commission two large petrochemicals projects in next two years. The petrochem project at Dahej in Gujarat, being developed by ONGC Petro-additions Ltd (OPAL), will be commissioned in 2012 and another by ONGC Mangalore Petrochemicals Ltd in 2013, Hazarika said. Hazarika said during the year the company achieved the highest ever production of 62.05 MT of oil and oil-equivalent gas from domestic and overseas assets. Also, production from overseas assets at 9.45 MT of oiland oil equivalent gas was also highest ever. This is interesting! ONGC seeks producing assets in politically stable countries Reserve accretion at 83.56 MT was the highest in last two decades from domestic acreages. ONGC, he said, had shelled out a record Rs 24,892 crore in fuel subsidy in 2010-11. &amp;quot;The upstream companies had to share subsidy burden by 38.8%, instead of past practices of 33.3 per cent.

2011-08-30T18:53:38+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,May give consent on Sept 27 for Cairn-Vedanta deal: ONGC,State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) today said it may on September 27 decide on giving its consent to UK's Cairn Energy Plc selling majority stake in Cairn India to London-listed Vedanta Resources.,"State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) today said it may on September 27 decide on giving its consent to UK's Cairn Energy Plc selling majority stake in Cairn India to London-listed Vedanta Resources. ONGC, which holds stake in 8 out of the 10 oil and gas properties Cairn India has in the country, holds pre-emption or right of first refusal. &amp;quot;We have to do valuation of the properties if ONGC should buyout Cairn India or not. A lot of work is being done... we are in the process of doing due diligence. The final call will be taken by the company board which is slated to meet next on September 27,&amp;quot; ONGC Chairman and Managing Director A K Hazarika told reporters here. Cairn Energy has agreed to accept all government conditions, including sharing royalty and paying cess on the all important Rajasthan oil block. Since, Cairn India is opposed to the riders, it has demanded that company shareholders should vote on acceptance of them. Cairn Energy with 52.11% stake and Vedanta's 28.5% are all set to overrule Cairn India and accept the conditions. &amp;quot;They (Cairn Energy) have written to us, saying they are accepting the conditions and results of the shareholder vote will be announced by September 14. Thereafter, they will write to us for no-objection certificate and we will take it to the next board meeting,&amp;quot; he said. Thus far, Cairn Energy had rejected existence of any pre- emption rights of ONGC and its deal to sell 40% stake in Cairn India triggering them. But the government approval to the USD 9 billion deal made it conditional on Cairn getting a no-objection certificate from ONGC. &amp;quot;NOC and right of first refusal are the same thing,&amp;quot; Hazarika said, adding that the company board will have to decide if acquiring Cairn India at Rs 355 per share -- the price Vedanta is paying Cairn Energy -- was economical to it. Cairn Energy Managing Director and CFO Jann Brown on August 16 wrote to Hazarika asking ONGC to begin the process of deciding on its consent so that NOC is granted by September 21. Hazarika said Cairn has to first apply formally requesting waiver of the ROFR, or in other words a consent for its deal with Vedanta. That letter Cairn can write only after it accepts to make royalty payments on Rajasthan block cost recoverable and withdraw arbitration challenging Cairn India's liability to pay cess on its 30% stake in the fields. Cairn India does not pay any royalty on its 70% interest in the Rajasthan fields. The royalty, as per the contract, is paid by ONGC, which got a 30% stake in the 6.5 billion barrel field for free. However, the royalty like other project cost and taxes, is recoverable from revenues earned from sale of oil.  ONGC Director (Finance) D K Sarraf said ONGC had paid about Rs 2,000 crore in royalty on its share and on that of Cairn India up to March 31, 2011. Once royalty is made cost recoverable, two-third of it will come back to ONGC. Similarly in first quarter, it paid Rs 780 crore in royalty, two-third of which will come back to the company. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on June 27 gave consent to the Cairn-Vedanta deal, but subject to Cairn or its successor agreeing to deducting the royalty paid by ONGC from revenues earned from sale of oil before profits are split between the partners. This cost recovery of royalty will lower Cairn India's profitability. Also, the CCEA said Cairn India must pay a Rs 2,500 per tonne cess on its 70% ent share of oil production. Cairn maintains that cess, like royalty, is a liability of ONGC and had initiated arbitration against the government on being forced to pay cess. Since the Cairn-Vedanta deal was announced in August last year, Cairn India has been opposed to making royalty payments recoverable from the sale of oil and the company being made liable to pay a Rs 2,500 per tonne cess, as this was not in line with the Production Sharing Contract (PSC). A change in the contract was neither in the interest of the company, nor its minority shareholders, it has maintained. Last August, Vedanta proposed buying a 51-60% stake in oil and gas explorer Cairn India for up to USD 9.6 billion in cash, but the deal has been delayed awaiting government and regulatory approvals. A Group of Ministers headed by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee had recommended to the Cabinet that the deal should be approved if Cairn or its successor agreed to royalty being added to the project cost and recovered from oil sales, as well as agreeing to pay its share of oil cess. Days before the CCEA accepted the GoM recommendation and gave conditional approval, Cairn Energy lowered the price it was demanding from Vedanta to make up for the reduced profitability due to acceptance of the preconditions. It removed a non-compete provision and the related non-compete fee of Rs 50 per share. Vedanta's total payment, at the reduced price of Rs 355 per share for a 40% stake in Cairn India, will now be USD 6.02 billion, instead of USD 6.84 billion earlier.","A K Hazarika, Business, Cairn India, Oil and Natural Gas Corp, ONGC, Vedanta Resources","A K Hazarika, Business, Cairn India, Oil and Natural Gas Corp, ONGC, Vedanta Resources",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/may-give-consentsept-27-for-cairn-vedanta-deal-ongc_581492.html

While production from some oil wells in the GS-15 field is set to commence from September, ONGC has also drawn up plans to initiate production from its G-1 marginal field in the KG Basin from July, 2012, an official said. ONGC has asked the Petroleum Ministry to identify users for the gas and approve a price of USD 4.75 per million British thermal units. About 0.19 million standard cubic metres per day of gas would be available for sale from September. The gas availability would go up to 1.52 mmscmd from July next year (subsequent to the G-1 field coming onstream) and to 1.72 mmscmd in 2013-14. ONGC cited the Oil Ministry's gas pricing order, which had fixed a base price of USD 4.50 per mmBtu for gas from the KG Basin and given an additional USD 0.25 per mmBtu if the gas was coming from offshore fields, to demand a gas price of USD 4.75 per mmBtu. The official said output will begin to dip from 2013-14 to 1.59 mmscmd and taper to 0.029 mmscmd by 2022-23. The field will also produce 9,400 barrels of crude oil per day. ONGC envisages the production of 0.982 million tonnes (MT) of sweet or low-sulfur crude and 5.92 billion cubic metres of gas over a period of 15 years from G-1 and GS-15. G-1 is located 28 kilometres off the Amalapuram coast, in water depths ranging from 135 to 500 metres, while GS-15 is located 5 km from the coast in the KG Basin. The official said G-1 and GS-15 are two marginal fields that were awarded to ONGC on a nomination basis. The two acreages are being developed together at an estimated cost of Rs 1,200 crore. According to the gas production profile, G-1 and GS-15 will produce 1.52 mmscmd in 2011-12, 1.72 mmscmd in 2012-13, 1.59 mmscmd in 2013-14, 1.36 mmscmd in 2014-15, 0.99 mmscmd in 2015-16, 0.87 mmscmd in 2016-17, 0.87 mmscmd in 2018-19, 1.11 mmscmd in 2019-20, 0.95 mmscmd in 2020-21, 0.71 mmscmd in 2021-22 and 0.029 mmscmd in 2022-23. The official said unless the Petroleum Ministry quickly approves the price of gas and identifies users, ONGC may end up flaring gas from G-1 and GS-15 next month. &amp;quot;The field is primarily an oil field and gas is produced as associated gas. So if there are no customers, we will produce oil and flare gas,&amp;quot; he said.","Business, GS-15, Oil and Natural Gas Corp","Business, GS-15, Oil and Natural Gas Corp",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-may-start-productionkg-basin-next-month_580786.html

With a market valuation of Rs 2,37,842 crore, slightly higher than RIL's Rs 2,35,571 crore, the PSU energy major reclaimed the top position from the private sector corporate giant after a gap of nearly four and half years. However, ONGC's lead over RIL is barely about 1% (about Rs 2,200 crore) and their performances would be keenly watched when stock market resumes trading next week. RIL had first toppled ONGC to become the country's most-valued firm way back in late 2006, but the state-run energy giant later reclaimed the top position, albeit only for a few brief period. RIL has managed to stay on the top since February 2007, except for past few days. A situation similar to game of musical chairs is evident in the stock market for past few days when there have been many twists and turns in the top positions of the country's most valued firms. Earlier on August 17, state-run Coal India Ltd (CIL) dethroned RIL as the top-valued firm, ending the private sector energy's giant over four-year reign at the top. Two days later on August 19, RIL briefly slipped to the third position after CIL and ONGC but returned to the second slot at the time of the market closing. However, CIL's top position proved to be short-lived as RIL reclaimed this position within six days on August 23. A day later on August 24, CIL lost further ground and slipped to the third position after RIL and ONGC. By afternoon trade today, another major change was seen on valuation charts when ONGC raced past RIL to the top slot. Thereafter, a close race was seen between the two energy giants as they pipped each other several times within minutes. However, PSU giant ONGC emerged victorious at the end of the day with a higher market capitalisation than that of RIL. Marketmen would be keenly watching RIL and ONGC shares when trading resumes next week to see whether ONGC will manage to retain and extend its lead over RIL or the private sector corporate giant bounces back to reclaim its top position, as it did after losing out to CIL last week. ONGC's lead over RIL stands at a little over Rs 2,000 crore, which is barely about 1%. In a weak market, shares of both Reliance Industries and ONGC fell today, but losses were sharper for RIL. While RIL was weak for the entire day almost, ONGC could not sustain the gains witnessed earlier in the trading session. RIL shares closed 4.61% down at Rs 719.50, while ONGC fell 1.49% to Rs 278 at the BSE. At the end of yesterday's trade, RIL was the country's most-valued firm with a market valuation of Rs 246,965 crore, followed by ONGC's Rs 241,436 crore. Both the stocks are trading at their lowest levels in many months. Coal India, the third most valued company after ONGC and RIL, also fell sharply with a loss of 3.9% in its share price and commanded a market value of Rs 2,27,231 crore. ONGC, RIL and Coal India are followed by TCS, Bharti Airtel, ITC, NTPC, Infosys, SBI and HDFC Bank among the top 10 most valued companies. The top three have market values in excess of Rs two lakh crore, while others are valued above Rs one lakh crore each.","Business, ONGC, Reliance Industries","Business, ONGC, Reliance Industries",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-overtakes-reliance-industries-as-most-valued-firm_580546.html

The firm has made 10 discoveries in the KG Basin's KG-DWN-98/2 block, which sits next to Reliance Industries' showpiece producing KG-D6 gas fields, Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas RPN Singh said today. &amp;quot;ONGC has submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (and) Directorate General of Hydrocarbons requesting permission for drilling eight additional exploratory/appraisal wells in block KG-DWN-98/2 and also seeking an extension of the exploration period for drilling these wells,&amp;quot; he said a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha. The state-run firm estimates that the block holds an in-place volume of 25.61 million tonne of oil and 197 billion cubic metres of natural gas. It is proposing an investment of over USD 7.7 billion to produce up to 30 million standard cubic metres per day of gas from the block. Singh said ONGC had submitted a proposal last year to declare its UD-1 ultra deep-sea gas discovery in the southern part of the block as commercial, a step toward developing the find. The Declaration of Commerciality (DoC) of the Northern area finds in the block were submitted by ONGC in July, 2010. &amp;quot;Since the said DoC was not approved at the Operating Committee (an oversight panel for the block), it could not be evaluated and the operator was asked to submit the OperatingCommittee-approved DoC,&amp;quot; he said. ONGC bought 90% interest in the block from Cairn Energy India Ltd in 2005. Cairn still holds 10% in the block. Before selling most of its stake and giving away operatorship of the block, Cairn made four discoveries in the area -- Padmavati, Kanakdurga, N-1 and R-1 (Annapurna). Subsequently, ONGC made six significant discoveries -- E-1, A1, U1, W1, D-1/KT-1 and the first ultra-deepwater discovery UD-1, at a record depth of 2,841 metres. The block is divided into a Northern Discovery Area (NDA) and Southern Discovery Area (SDA). The NDA comprises discoveries like Padmawati, Kanadurga, D, E, U and A, while the ultra deep-sea UD find lies in the SDA.

Reliance has sub-let its Transocean-owned ultra-deep water drillship Dhirubhai Deepwater KG-2 to Petronas at least till the year-end, industry sources said. Dhirubhai Deepwater KG-2, a high specification ultra-deep water drillship capable of operating in 12,000 feet of water and drilling to 35,000 feet, may drill two wells for Petronas off the coast of Brunei, beginning next month, which may take up to four months to complete. Following the move, Reliance does not have any operational offshore drilling rigs in Indian waters, sources said. Reliance had in March last year received Dhirubhai Deepwater KG-2 from Transocean on a five-year contract at a day rate of USD 510,000, sources said, adding that the Mukesh Ambani-led firm is charging the same day rate from Petronas. A company spokesperson did not reply to an email sent for comments. Reliance has not drilled all of the wells it had committed in 2006 to win approval for investing up to USD 8.8 billion on its showpiece eastern offshore KG-D6 block. Natural gas production from the block, at 47 million cubic metres per day, is 31% less than the target, a phenomenon which the oil regulator, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), says was on account of not drilling the required number of wells. Reliance has so far drilled only 20 out of the 22 wells committed by March, 2011, in the main Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields of the KG-D6 block. As per its 2006 commitment, the number of producing wells should go up to 31 by the end of the current fiscal. Sources said without a drilling rig, it cannot drill any well this fiscal. The DGH wants Reliance to immediately take up drilling of the 11 committed wells so as to raise output, which had in March last year touched 61 mmcmd. Production has since late last year declined amid falling pressure in the wells. Reliance currently holds 90% interest in KG-D6, while the rest is with Niko Resources of Canada. It is selling a 30% stake in the block and 22 others to UK's BP Plc for over USD 7 billion. In 2009, Reliance had sub-let another rig, Dhirubhai Deepwater KG-1, to state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) at a dayrate of USD 495,000 to 510,000 for four years (about Rs 3,195 crore). ONGC was to pay a day rate of USD 495,000 to Reliance for the first 180 days and USD 510,000 from the 181st day onward.","Business, Oil and Natural Gas Corp, Petronas, Reliance Industries","Business, Oil and Natural Gas Corp, Petronas, Reliance Industries",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ril-sub-lets-sole-drilling-rig-to-malaysias-petronas_580023.html

Cairn Energy, which owns a 52.11% stake in Cairn India, &amp;quot;has voted to accept (government) conditions&amp;quot;, the company said in a press statement. The Edinburgh-based firm, which is selling a 40% stake in Cairn India to Vedanta, has till now maintained that forcing its Indian unit to pay royalty and cess on the mainstay Rajasthan oil block was against the signed contract and would hurt minority shareholders' interest. &amp;quot;Two of the government of India conditions -- cess and royalty payable -- are currently with Cairn India shareholders for approval, Cairn has voted to accept these conditions, with voting results due on September 14,&amp;quot; the statement said. Together with Vedanta's 28.5% shareholding, Cairn Energy has enough votes to get any proposal passed by its shareholders, ignoring the resolution passed by the Cairn India board in February opposing the value demolishing preconditions. Minority shareholders at Cairn India's AGM in Mumbai last week had booed Cairn Energy for changing track to get USD 6.02 billion from the stake sale to Vedanta. Cairn Energy had previously said it would rather call off the deal than force Cairn India to accept these conditions. Cairn India had on July 26 stated that its April-June quarter net profit would halve to Rs 1,435 crore if it was asked to share royalty on the Rajasthan crude oil. The company currently does not pay any royalty on its 70% interest in the Rajasthan fields. The royalty, as per the contract, is paid by state-owned ONGC, which got a 30% stake in the 6.5 billion barrel field for free. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on June 27 gave consent to the Cairn-Vedanta deal, subject to Cairn or its successor agreeing to charge or deduct the royalty paid by ONGC from the revenues earned from the sale of oil before the profits are split between partners. This cost-recovery of royalty will lower Cairn India's profitability. Also, the CCEA said Cairn India must pay a Rs 2,500 per tonne cess on its 70% share of oil production. Cairn maintains that cess, like royalty, is a liability of ONGC and had initiated arbitration against the government on being forced to pay cess. Cairn Energy, in the statement, said, &amp;quot;Sale of 40% shareholding in Cairn India to Vedanta (will) be completed in two stages. The first tranche of 10%, which realised about USD 1.4 billion (was) completed (in) July, 2011. &amp;quot;The second tranche of 30%, approved by the government of India (GoI) in June, subject to certain conditions, will realise about USD 4 billion,&amp;quot; it said. Cairn Energy said the Mangala field in the Rajasthan block currently produces 125,000 barrels of oil per day. Development of Bhagyam, the second biggest oilfield in the block after Mangala, was on track and is scheduled to commence production in the fourth quarter of 2011. Cairn India, it said, had net cash of USD 1.048 billion, comprising USD 1.452 billion in cash and USD 404 million in debt. &amp;quot;Cairn (Energy) is encouraged that the Vedanta transaction is moving toward completion. Following approval from the government of India, all parties are now working to satisfy the consents and conditions to complete the sale to Vedanta as soon as possible,&amp;quot; company CEO Simon Thomson said. &amp;quot;The sale of Cairn Energy's 40% stake will allow a return of substantial funds to shareholders and will also provide the group with the balance sheet strength and financial flexibility to explore new opportunities in line with its consistent strategy of seeking transformational growth,&amp;quot; Thomson added.","accept government's conditions, Business, Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, Cairn Energy, Cairn India, pay royalty, Rajasthan oilfields, Vedanta Resources","accept government's conditions, Business, Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, Cairn Energy, Cairn India, pay royalty, Rajasthan oilfields, Vedanta Resources",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cairn-energy-tells-its-indian-arm-to-accept-govt-conditions_579059.html

Earlier in the day, CIL had even slipped below ONGC to the third position in market valuation charts, but PSU energy giant lost ground in the afternoon trade and its shares ended the day at Rs 279.15 with a 2.65% decline -- the maximum for any Sensex stock in today's trade. ONGC had a market valuation of Rs 2,38,826 crore at the end of today's trade, making it the country's third most valued company after RIL and CIL. In late morning trade, the shares of all three -- RIL, CIL and ONGC -- were trading in the red and losses were much sharper for the coal major. At 1145 hrs, RIL had the top market value of Rs 2,46,507 crore on the BSE, followed by ONGC's Rs 2,42,847 crore and CIL's Rs 2,41,822 crore. While RIL was down 0.44% at Rs 752.90, ONGC was 1.01% down at Rs 283.85 and CIL was trading 3.15% lower at Rs 382.85 at that time. However, RIL rebounded sharply in afternoon trade, CIL also pared some of its losses and ONGC lost further ground. At the end of yesterday's trade, Coal India was ranked the most valued company with a market capitalisation of Rs 249,685.88 crore, followed by RIL's 249,685.88 crore and ONGC's 245,328.68 crore. CIL toppled Reliance Industries on August 17 to emerge as the country's most valued firm, thus ending the private sector corporate giant's over four-year reign at the top of the market valuation charts. Two days later on August 19, RIL briefly fell behind ONGC to the third position in the market valuation charts, but returned to the second slot before the market close that day. CIL and ONGC have been closing the gap on RIL in terms of market valuation for the past few weeks, as RIL's stock has been under selling pressure and the two PSUs have been mostly performing well even in a weak market. However, a sharp rally in RIL stock for two trading sessions and today's fall in CIL shares helped the private sector corporate giant regain its lead over the coal major. RIL had first toppled ONGC to become the country's most valued firm way back in late 2006, but the state-run energy giant later reclaimed its top position, albeit only for a brief period. RIL has managed to stay on the top since February, 2007, except for the past few days. The recent bout of volatility in stock market has led to many upheavals in the market valuation charts. Coal India and ONGC had come very close to challenging RIL's top-position last month also, while the rankings of other top-10 companies have also undergone many changes in the recent past. IT major Infosys, which once figured among the top-five companies, has now slipped to the ninth position, while ICICI Bank has moved out of the top-10 to 11th slot. At the same time, ITC has moved to the fifth position. In the top-10, RIL is now followed by Coal India, ONGC, TCS, ITC, Bharti Airtel, NTPC, SBI, Infosys and HDFC Bank. Out of these, the top-three have market value in excess of Rs two lakh crore, while the others carry a valuation of more than Rs 1 lakh crore.","Bombay Stock Exchange, Business, Coal India, Mukesh Ambani, ONGC, PSU, Reliance Industries","Bombay Stock Exchange, Business, Coal India, Mukesh Ambani, ONGC, PSU, Reliance Industries",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ril-regains-lost-glory-pips-cil-as-most-valued-firm_578989.html

In June, the oil ministry came under criticism from the state auditor for what it said was allowing some exploring companies to overstate costs of field developments and exploring beyond their contracted areas. The Comptroller and Auditor General's (CAG) draft report said energy major Reliance Industries had inflated development costs on its D6 block in the Krishna-Godavari basin and cited a joint venture of Reliance with BG and ONGC for hiking development costs in the Panna-Mukta and Tapti gas fields. Reliance is already facing criticism for pumping less gas than it should from the key D6 block, one of the biggest gas producing blocks in India. &amp;quot;PM will take a review meeting soon but no definite date is known to us,&amp;quot; the Economic Times quoted an unnamed oil ministry official as saying. It said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will also assess the performance of state-run oil companies, some of which have posted losses in the first quarter of the current year. He is also expected to review the burgeoning fuel subsidy bill and delays in key appointments to state oil firms, the report said. The possible review by the prime minister comes at a time when his coalition's political capital is being sapped by popular protests against government corruption.","Business, CAG, Comptroller and Auditor General, Manmohan Singh, oil ministry, ONGC, Reliance Industries","Business, CAG, Comptroller and Auditor General, Manmohan Singh, oil ministry, ONGC, Reliance Industries",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/under-fire-oil-ministry-to-face-pm-scrutiny_578086.html

OVL and other PSUs have properties in more than 20 countries including Russia, Sudan, Vietnam, Venezuela, Syria and Columbia, Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas R P N Singh said in a written reply to Lok Sabha today. &amp;quot;OVL has produced about 9.448 million tonne of oil and equivalent gas during the year 2010-11 from its assets abroad,&amp;quot; he said. In order to ensure energy security, the government is encouraging national oil companies to pursue equity oil and gas opportunities abroad. OVL has assets in 14 countries. &amp;quot;The total investment by oil PSUs overseas is approximately Rs 64,832 crore,&amp;quot; he said. OVL's purchase of Imperial Energy is the largest acquisition of a foreign company by an oil PSU. &amp;quot;By 2020, OVL aims to exceed an annual production level of 20 million tonne of oil and equivalent gas,&amp;quot; he said. Its parent firm, ONGC has seen crude oil production drop from 25.4 million tonnes in 2008-09 to 24.4 million tonne in 2010-11.

The five state-owned units which were accorded the status were ONGC, NTPC, IOC, SAIL and CIL, Minister of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Praful Patel said in a written reply to the Lok Sabha. BHEL and GAIL are the other two PSUs which have applied for the status, the minister said. To be eligible for the grant of the Maharatna status, the company should have an average turnover of over Rs 25,000 crore, average annual net worth of more than Rs 15,000 crore and average annual net profit of over Rs 5,000 crore during the last three years, Patel said. Besides, it should be a Navratna firm, should be listed on the Indian Stock Exchange with minimum prescribed public shareholding under the SEBI regulations and have global presence, the minister added. The government had introduced the Maharatna status for CPSEs in February 2010. The proposals for grant of the Maharatna tag to CPSEs are required to be initiated by the concerned ministry/department and forwarded it to the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE). Patel said the proposals for grant of Maharatna status to CPSEs are initially considered by the inter-ministerial committee and thereafter by the apex committee. Once a company gets the Maharatna status, its board would not be required to take the government's permission for investments up to Rs 5,000 crore in a joint venture project or wholly-owned subsidiary. For the Navratna companies, the limit is Rs 1,000 crore.","Business, Central Public Sector Enterprises, CIL, IOC, Maharatna, NTPC, ONGC, SAIL","Business, Central Public Sector Enterprises, CIL, IOC, Maharatna, NTPC, ONGC, SAIL",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/five-companies-granted-maharatna-status-govt_577797.html

Talking to newsmen here on the occasion of 56th foundation day, Pandey said, &amp;quot;The basin has a target to drill 49 exploratory wells this financial year and also to deploy two 3D-3C, 5 3D and one 2D seismic crew for acquiring high resolution seismic data&amp;quot;. The target for drilling of wells is higher this year due to success in drilling of 43 exploratory wells last year, 21 of which were hydrocarbon bearing. The success percentage of wells drilled to hydrocarbon bearing was 55.6 per cent which means that for every 1.8 wells drilled, one well was proved successful, said Pandey adding this ratio was considered quite creditable in the hydrocarbon industry. The significant new finds of the basin in 2010-11, include Vadtal 1, Vadtal 3 and Aliabet 2, of which Aliabet promises to be good find for ONGC, Pandey said. After failure of GSPCL in finding oil and gas from shallow water in Aliabet, ONGC took it over and started drilling wells there. &amp;quot;We have started getting about 1.5 lakh cubic meter gas per day from two drilled wells in Aliabet, which promises to be a good find for us,&amp;quot; Pandey said. &amp;quot;Now we will take up a cluster of four wells in this region to save expenditure being incurred on exploration and will start commercial production from it after getting oil from it first, said Pandey. Because of infrastructure problems and non-availability of shallow rig, the work of drilling of wells in Aliabet is getting delayed, he said. After Ankleshwar and Gandhar oil and gas field, both Aliabet and Vadtal may turn out to be prospective oil and gas fields, Pandey hoped.  Pandey said a proposal has been sent to the government for increasing production of gas from the gas fields located at Gandhar, about 100 km from Vadodara. The discovery of huge quantity of gas from the fields in Gandhar in 1983 changed the industrial scenario in Gujarat and other parts of the country as it turned out to be the best region for gas production in the country. After 28 years since its inception, the production of gas from the Gandhar fields has started declining. The same is the case with wells drilled in Ankleshwar region in neighbouring Bharuch district from where oil was struck in 1960. Pandey said that wells are being drilled in the area to get more oil. Meanwhile, commercial production of gas from three wells dug up in Kayavarohan village,about 15 km from Vadodara, will start soon, Pandey stated adding the company has also taken up of drilling of 8 wells in Padra taluka of the district.","Business, exploratory wells, GSPCL, hydrocarbon industry, ONGC, P B Pandey","Business, exploratory wells, GSPCL, hydrocarbon industry, ONGC, P B Pandey",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-to-spend-rs-1000crexplorationguj-rajasthan_576385.html

ONGC yesterday signed a seven-year contract with Forbes Bumi Armada Offshore Ltd (FBAOL) - a joint venture between Malaysia's Bumi Armada and BSE-listed Forbes &amp;amp;amp; Co Ltd - for hiring a floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO), officials said here. Reliance Industries has been using a FPSO since September, 2008, to produce oil from its MA field in the predominantly gas-rich KG-D6 block off the East Coast.

A FPSO is a converted or custom-built ship-shaped floater used to process oil and gas and for temporary storage of oil prior to transshipment. The FPSO processes oil coming from undersea wells and stores it before transferring it for sale to refineries for processing. ONGC has hired the FPSO for a seven-year fixed term time charter, with a further six-year annual extension period at ONGC's discretion.

2011-08-11T18:35:54+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,"Govt share of revenue from Cairn to fall by Rs 5,032cr","The government today said its share of revenue from Cairn India's Rajasthan oilfields will fall by Rs 5,032 crore if royalty payments are made cost-recoverable as part of Vedanta Resources' plan to acquire the company.","The government today said its share of revenue from Cairn India's Rajasthan oilfields will fall by Rs 5,032 crore if royalty payments are made cost-recoverable as part of Vedanta Resources' plan to acquire the company. Cairn India at present does not pay any royalty on its 70% interest in its mainstay Rajasthan oilfields. The royalty is paid by state-owned ONGC, which got a 30% stake in the 6.5 billion barrel field for free. Minister of State for Petroleum and Natural Gas R P N Singh said the government has approved UK's Cairn Energy Plc selling 40% stake in its Indian unit to Vedanta Resources subject to the buyer/seller agreeing to treat royalty paid by ONGC as cost recoverable. Cairn is allowed to recover all project cost (capital, operating expenditure and taxes) from revenues earned from selling oil before splitting the profits with the government.  Making royalty cost recoverable means it will be considered as project cost and subsequent revenues left for splitting between Cairn India, ONGC and the government will be lower. &amp;quot;As per projections made on the basis of assumptions on production, crude oil price, exchange rate etc, in Net Present Value (NPV) terms, the Government of India's share of profit petroleum is reduced by Rs 5,032 crore, that of Cairn India's by Rs 6,272 crore and ONGC by Rs 2,688 crore over the life of the project ie till 2020,&amp;quot; Singh said. &amp;quot;However, in this situation, ONGC would recover the cost of royalty paid by them to the state government on behalf of themselves and Cairn, amounting to Rs 13,995 crore in NPV terms, over the life of the project,&amp;quot; he said in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha here today. He said as per the Production Sharing Contract (PSC), ONGC as licensee has the obligation to bear 100% royalty burden. However, as per the Accounting Procedure prescribed in the PSC, royalty paid is cost recoverable by ONGC as contract cost. &amp;quot;Government granted consent to the proposed Cairn-Vedanta deal by stipulating a condition that the parties shall agree and give an undertaking that the royalty paid by ONGC in the RJ-ON-90/1 (Rajasthan) block is cost recoverable by ONGC as contract costs, as per the provisions of the PSC,&amp;quot; he said. After initially resisting, Cairn Energy has said it will accept the rider set by the government.  Cairn Energy Chairman Bill Gammell, who had till recently maintained that making royalty cost recoverable and asking Cairn India to pay cess on its share in Rajasthan block was against the signed contract and would hurt minority shareholder's interest, on August 3 wrote to Oil Secretary G C Chaturvedi saying all the preconditions set by the government were acceptable to the company and Vedanta.  To get USD 6.02 billion from the sale of a 40% stake, Gammell said Cairn Energy and Vedanta will vote at a shareholders' meet for acceptance of the royalty and cess riders, ignoring the resolution passed by the Cairn India board in February opposing the value demolishing preconditions. &amp;quot;Cairn UK Holdings Ltd (a wholly owned subsidiary of Cairn Energy), holding 52.11% of the issued share capital of Cairn India, and Vedanta Resources Plc Group, holding an aggregate of 28.5% of the issued share capital of Cairn India, shall both be voting in favour of acceptance&amp;quot; of these conditions, Gammell wrote. Cairn India had on July 26 stated that its April-June quarter net profit would halve to Rs 1,435 crore if it was asked to share royalty on crude oil produced from the Rajasthan fields. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on June 27 gave consent to the Cairn-Vedanta deal, but subject to Cairn or its successor agreeing to cost recovery of royalty as well as Cairn India agreeing to pay Rs 2,500 per tonne cess on its 70% share of oil production.

India in June granted conditional approval for Vedanta Resources to buy a stake in Cairn India in a USD 6 billion deal that was first announced in August 2010. Cairn India is currently seeking approval from its shareholders on the conditions imposed by the Indian government via postal ballot. &amp;quot;Cairn Energy has set out a timetable for shareholder approval by September 14,&amp;quot; a source close to the company told Reuters on Wednesday. Analysts expect Cairn India shareholders to approve the conditions, following which Cairn and Vedanta will be able to complete the deal. Cairn originally predicted that the sale of its stakes to Vedanta would be finalised by the end of 2010. The mid-September timetable for shareholder approval is in line with what Vedanta officials indicated in late July when they said they expected the deal to complete within six weeks to two months. The parties had agreed to satisfy India's conditions by the end of August, including an undertaking from Cairn India that it and state-controlled ONGC would share the burden of royalty payments that are currently only paid by ONGC. &amp;quot;Cairn Energy is working to satisfy the conditions set by the government of India to the agreed timetable,&amp;quot; said a spokesman for Cairn Energy.

2011-08-09T13:51:26+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,OVL qualifies for Iraq's oil exploration bidding,"ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), is among 41 international oil majors who have qualified for Iraq's fourth bidding round for exploration blocks.","ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), is among 41 international oil majors who have qualified for Iraq's fourth bidding round for exploration blocks. Besides OVL, others who have qualified to bid for the 12 exploration blocks due to be awarded in January next year are ExxonMobil, Shell, Total, BP, Chevron and a host of multinational oil companies. Industry sources said 50 companies had submitted qualification documents for consideration by a June 6 deadline. Of these 41 qualified. The Iraqi oil ministry is planning to hold a roadshow at the end of September with contracts due to be awarded on January 25 or 26. Sources said OVL had bid for the giant Halfaya oilfield along with state-run Oil India Ltd and Turkish Petroelum Corp (TPAO) in Iraq's second post-war bid round in December 2009. It lost the bid for the third largest field on offer in that round to a consortium led by a Chinese firm. A group led by China National Petroleum Corp bid lower than the USD 1.76 per barrel fee OVL and partners sought for boosting output from Halfaya field to 550,000 barrels per day. CNPC, Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) and Total SA offered to boost production to 535,000 bpd from current 3,000 bpd at a cost of USD 1.40 a barrel. The Halfaya oilfield has estimated reserves of 4.1 billion barrels of oil. OVL had, in the first round in June that year, lost the Zubair oilfield when it along with OAO Gazprom of Russia and TPAO had asked for a remuneration that was about five times higher than USD 1.90-2 a barrel that Baghdad was willing to pay. The Indian firm had also qualified for the third round last year but failed to make the mark. In the fourth round, Iraq is offering seven gas fields and five oilfields. Iraq, holder of the world's third-largest oil reserves, is seeking foreign investments to boost output after six years of conflict destroyed its infrastructure. Bidders must accept service contracts that pay them a flat fee for each barrel extracted, rather than production-sharing agreements in which they gain a stake in the crude produced. A service contract means that they do not benefit from a rise in oil prices. Sources said the formula for the two bidding parameters -- the dollar-per-barrel remuneration fee and plateau production target -- has been weighted 80% toward the fee, with the aim of dissuading companies from promising unrealistically high output targets. Companies qualifying for the Iraq's fourth bid round were dominated by Japanese firms which included Inpex Corp, JX Nippon, Mitsubishi Corp, Mitsui and Sumitomo. Russia's Bashneft, Gazprom, Lukoil, Rosneft and TNK-BP too qualified along with US' ExxonMobil, Chevron, Hess Corp and Occidental. Three Chinese firms - Cnooc, CNPC and Petrochina also figure in the list of 41. Also among those qualified were Edison and Eni of Italy, BP and Premier Oil of the UK, Anglo-Dutch Shell, Norway's Statoil and France's Total. The Egyptian General Petroleum Corp, Kuwait Energy, the UAE's Mubadala, Angola's Sonangol and Turkey's TPAO are also among bidders. The qualifiers also include Korean Kogas, Pakistan Petroleum, Petro Vietnam E&amp;amp;amp;P, Petronas of Malaysia, Pertamina of Indonesia and Thailand's PTTEP International Holding Company. Iraq has signed 12 oil field development contracts with international companies including ExxonMobil, BP, Shell, Eni, Lukoil and the Chinese National Petroleum Corp since late 2009, and plans to increase oil production capacity from 2.7 million barrels per day now to more than 13 million bpd inseven years.","BP, Business, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Iraqi oil ministry, ONGC Videsh Ltd, Shell, Total","BP, Business, Chevron, ExxonMobil, Iraqi oil ministry, ONGC Videsh Ltd, Shell, Total",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ovl-qualifies-for-iraqs-oil-exploration-bidding_574573.html

2011-08-08T12:27:23+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,Cairn okays all govt conditions for Vedanta stake sale,"After pooh-poohing for almost a year, UK's Cairn Energy Plc has said it will accept all riders the government has attached for giving approval to its stake sale in Cairn India to mining group Vedanta Resources.","After pooh-poohing for almost a year, UK's Cairn Energy Plc has said it will accept all riders the government has attached for giving approval to its stake sale in Cairn India to mining group Vedanta Resources. Cairn Energy Chairman Bill Gammell, who had till recently maintained that forcing Cairn India to pay royalty and cess on the mainstay Rajasthan oil block was against the signed contract and would hurt minority shareholder's interest, on August 3 wrote to Oil Secretary G C Chaturvedi saying all the preconditions set by the government were acceptable to the company and Vedanta. To get USD 6.02 billion from the sale of a 40% stake, Gammell said Cairn Energy and Vedanta will vote at a shareholders' meet for acceptance of the royalty and cess riders, ignoring the resolution passed by the Cairn India board in February opposing the value demolishing preconditions. &amp;quot;Cairn UK Holdings Ltd (a wholly owned subsidiary of Cairn Energy), holding 52.11% of the issued share capital of Cairn India, and Vedanta Resources Plc Group, holding an aggregate of 28.5% of the issued share capital of Cairn India, shall both be voting in favour of acceptance&amp;quot; of these conditions, Gammell wrote. Cairn India had on July 26 stated that its April-June quarter net profit would halve to Rs 1,435 crore if it was asked to share royalty on crude oil produced from the Rajasthan fields. The company currently does not pay any royalty on its 70% interest in the Rajasthan fields. The royalty, as per the contract, is paid by state-owned ONGC, which got a 30% stake in the 6.5 billion barrel field for free. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on June 27 gave consent to the Cairn-Vedanta deal, but subject to Cairn or its successor agreeing to charging or deducting the royalty paid by ONGC from revenues earned from sale of oil before profits are split between the partners. This cost recovery of royalty will lower Cairn India's profitability. Also, the CCEA said Cairn India must pay a Rs 2,500 per tonne cess on its 70% share of oil production. Cairn maintains that cess, like royalty, is a liability of ONGC and had initiated arbitration against the government on being forced to pay cess. Gammell said Cairn Energy and Vedanta will vote in a postal ballot being conducted among Cairn India shareholders for withdrawal of the cess arbitration. Cairn Energy, together with Vedanta, has 80% voting rights in Cairn India and can overrule the objections of minority shareholders to see any proposal through. &amp;quot;We expect the results of the shareholder vote to be announced in September and hope thereafter to be in a position to comply with all of the conditions set,&amp;quot; he wrote, seeking an extension of the one-month deadline the government has set for acceptance of the conditions. Since the board of Cairn India, which Gammell chaired on February 10, opposed accepting the government preconditions, Cairn Energy wants these conditions to be voted on by the company shareholders. Besides Vedanta furnishing financial and performance guarantees and an undertaking to keep Cairn India's technical capability undisturbed, the preconditions include Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) -- Cairn India's partner in most of its 10 properties in India -- giving a no objection certificate, as well as the Home Ministry giving security clearance to Vedanta. Since the Cairn-Vedanta deal was announced in August last year, Cairn India has been opposed to making royalty payments recoverable from the sale of oil and the company being made liable to pay a Rs 2,500 per tonne cess, as this was not in line with the Production Sharing Contract (PSC). A change in the contract was neither in the interest of the company, nor its minority shareholders, it has maintained.&amp;amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;It should be noted that if royalty were to be cost recoverable, it would lead to a decline in the revenues and profit-after-tax for the current quarter by Rs 1,291.6 crore,&amp;quot; Cairn India said, announcing its Q1 earnings on July 26.&amp;amp;nbsp; Cairn India reported a 10-fold jump in net profit to Rs 2,726.6 crore for the April-June quarter. Last August, Vedanta proposed buying a 51-60% stake in oil and gas explorer Cairn India for up to USD 9.6 billion in cash, but the deal has been delayed due to the lack of government and regulatory approvals. A Group of Ministers headed by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee had recommended to Cabinet that the deal should be approved if Cairn or its successor agreed to royalty being added to the project cost and recovered from oil sales, as well as agreed to pay its share of the Rs 2,500 per tonne oil cess. Days before the CCEA accepted the GoM recommendation and gave conditional approval, Cairn Energy lowered the price it was demanding from Vedanta to make up for the reduced profitability from acceptance of the preconditions. It removed a non-compete provision and related non-compete fee of Rs 50 per share. Vedanta's total payment, at the reduced price of Rs 355 per share for a 40% stake in Cairn India, will now be USD 6.02 billion, instead of USD 6.84 billion previously.","Business, Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, Cairn Energy Plc, Cairn India, Cairn-Vedanta deal, CCEA, ONGC, Pranab Mukherjee, Vedanta Resources","Business, Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, Cairn Energy Plc, Cairn India, Cairn-Vedanta deal, CCEA, ONGC, Pranab Mukherjee, Vedanta Resources",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cairn-okays-all-govt-conditions-for-vedanta-stake-sale_573950.html

Pressure groups including Survival International, Amnesty International and others have long opposed the projected mine -- planned for an area considered sacred by indigenous people -- as well as proposals to increase capacity at Vedanta's Lanjigarh alumina refinery to 6 million tonnes per year from 1 million. They were joined last year by asset manager Aviva Investors, part of insurer Aviva, and a small but vocal shareholder whose move to join the protest marked a more activist stance from institutional investors on social issues. Aviva has said it welcomed progress from Vedanta on social issues, including the appointment of a chief sustainability officer, but said this month it would withhold support for three key resolutions at the annual meeting. Vedanta, one of India's biggest aluminium producers and keen to capitalise on growing demand in the subcontinent, has denied its plans for expansion at Lanjigarh would harm the indigenous Dongria Kondh people, saying it would help lift mineral-rich Orissa out of poverty. Last week, the Orissa High Court upheld the government's decision to halt the refinery expansion plans. Vedanta can, however, submit a new bid for environmental clearance. Vedanta, 62%-owned by the Agarwal family, is also likely to face questions over corporate governance, an issue of increased debate in the mining sector after a storm at rival ENRC last month forced a corporate governance review. Like Vedanta, ENRC has hefty founder-shareholders -- a phenomenon not uncommon elsewhere but unusual in US and UK markets where ownership tends to be more dispersed. It is also likely to update shareholders on progress in the long-delayed deal to purchase Cairn India, given conditional approval by the Indian government last month. The parties are negotiating over royalties, with India's oil ministry pushing Cairn India to share these with the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp. ONGC has a 30% stake but pays 100% of royalties.

Sources said the letter was immediately faxed to Edinburgh, where the board of Cairn India, whose chairman is Bill Gammell (the head of Cairn Energy), was meeting to approved earnings for the first quarter ended June 30. Cairn Energy wants the approval letter to be taken up by the Cairn India board at today's meeting itself, they said.&amp;amp;nbsp; The CCEA had on June 30 given its approval to Cairn Energy for selling its Indian unit to Vedanta subject to the new owner agreeing to share royalty and pay oil cess on mainstay Rajasthan oilfields. Sources said since the approval involved conditional access, the oil ministry sent the letter informing of the decision to the law ministry for vetting. The Law Minister Salman Khurshid yesterday approved the draft and today the oil ministry sent the letter to Cairn India, which is the company that applied for permission for change of control in its 10 properties, including thecrown-jewel Rajasthan oilfields. Government's nod to the transaction is subject to Cairn or its successor agreeing to treat royalty payments on Rajasthan oilfields as recoverable from oil sales. Also, Cairn India will have to withdraw the arbitration it has initiated disputing its liability to pay Rs 2,500 per tonne oil cess on its 70% share in the fields. Besides, the approval will be subject to ONGC, which has a stake in all the three oil and gas producing properties and five out of seven exploration assets of Cairn India, waiving its pre-emption rights, which CCEA termed as the partner's no-objection certificate (NOC). The deal would also need the security clearance, they said.  Last August, London-listed miner Vedanta proposed buying 51-60% of oil and gas explorer Cairn India for up to USD 9.6 billion in cash, but the deal has been delayed due to lack of government and regulatory approvals. Approval has been delayed over royalty payments that ONGC makes on behalf of Cairn India in Rajasthan oilfields.&amp;amp;nbsp; ONGC owns a 30% stake in Cairn India's Rajasthan oil field but pays the entire royalty on production under the government's previous policy of giving discounts to attract investors. ONGC had, much before the Cairn-Vedanta deal was announced, cited contractual provisions to demand that the royalty to be recovered as a cost from revenue. The state-owned firm maintained that as a partner it has preemption, or right of first refusal, and the deal should not proceed without its concurrence, Reddy said.&amp;amp;nbsp; Both Cairn and Vedanta disputed royalty being made cost recoverable as it would dent Cairn India profits. They also opposed the need for partner consent for the transaction.&amp;amp;nbsp; A Group of Ministers headed by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, which was asked by CCEA to vet the deal, held that ONGC's views were correct and recommended to the Cabinet that the deal be approved if Cairn or its successor agreeing to adding royalty to the project cost and recovered from oil sales besides agreeing to pay its share of Rs 2,500 per tonne oil cess. Sensing the mood, Cairn last month lowered the price it is demanding from Vedanta to make up for reduced profitability on acceptance of the preconditions. It removed a non-compete provision and related non-compete fee of Rs 50 per share. Vedanta's total payment at the reduced price of Rs 355 per share for a 40% stake in Cairn India will now be USD 6.02 billion instead of USD 6.84 billion previously.","Business, Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, Cairn India, Cairn-Vedanta deal, oil ministry, ONGC, Pranab Mukherjee, Rajasthan oilfields, Salman Khurshid","Business, Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, Cairn India, Cairn-Vedanta deal, oil ministry, ONGC, Pranab Mukherjee, Rajasthan oilfields, Salman Khurshid",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/oilmin-sends-letters-to-cairn-vedanta-giving-approval_569330.html

Cairn India, whose board had on February 10 passed resolutions opposing change in contract to make the company liable for payment of royalty and cess on oil produced from its showpiece Rajasthan fields, does not mention a word in its annual report on the same being made a precondition by the government for approving Cairn-Vedanta deal. The company has so far maintained that Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) which got 30% stake in the prolific Rajasthan oil fields for free, is contractually liable to pay royalty and cess on the entire production. Also read: Cairn-Vedanta deal gets conditional clearance Besides the board resolution, Cairn India had since its parent Cairn Energy announced sale of 40% interest in the company to Vedanta in August last year, written letters opposing it being asked to pay Rs 2,500 per tonne cess and making royalty cost recoverable. But now that the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) has actually made cost recovery of royalty and payment of cess as preconditions for approval of the USD 9-billion deal, Cairn India Managing Director and CEO Rahul Dhir in the annual report for 2010-11 did not mention a word on it. &amp;quot;What ought to have been a straightforward transaction subject to shareholder approval has now been drawn into the government's decision-making ambit,&amp;quot; he said, adding Cairn India has not been informed of CCEA decision till now. Analysts tracking the deal said it was strange for a company, which was 'out-of-turn' so vocal, to have suddenly gone silent. &amp;quot;Acceptance of the preconditions were for the current owner (Cairn Energy) and the new owner (Vedanta) to decide. Yet Cairn India out-of-turn passed board resolution opposing it saying they were not in the interest of the company and its shareholders,&amp;quot; an analyst said. &amp;quot;If the silence is a sign of its acceptance of the preconditions, Cairn India will have to explain at least to the minority shareholders what changed for it to suddenly accept the riders. Can it compromise on minority shareholder interest to facilitate one shareholder to exit,&amp;quot; another analyst asked. The CCEA decision imposing preconditions was announced by the Oil Minister S Jaipal Reddy at a press conference. Dhir in the annual report said, &amp;quot;the long hiatus starting from mid-August 2010, when the deal was announced, has caused delays and uncertainty in managing a business that necessarily has to deal with the government and the Rajasthan joint venture partner, ONGC.&amp;quot;  Though Dhir did not elaborate on the &amp;quot;hiatus&amp;quot; in decision making, he may have made an apparent reference to delay in government approval for raising output from Mangala oilfield in the Rajasthan block to 150,000 barrels per day from current 125,000 bpd. In the section 'Management Decision &amp;amp;amp; Analysis', Cairn India said it in 2010-11 fiscal &amp;quot;faced considerable uncertainty arising out of the proposed transaction between Cairn Energy PLC and the Vedanta Resources Plc.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Unfortunately, the transaction has been dogged by serious delays, objections by ONGC and major interventions by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. These have been escalated to the level of the CCEA, which then sought the views of a Group of Ministers (GoM) of the Government of India (GoI),&amp;quot; it said. Even before Vedanta made its move, ONGC had demanded that royalties it pays on its and Cairn India's share in the Rajasthan fields be added to costs and recouped through sales, citing provisions in its contract. After the deal was announced, it maintained it had pre-emption rights and that the acquisition could not go ahead without its agreement. The CCEA last month overruled objections to ONGC's demand by Cairn/Vedanta and held these will have to be met before the approval is granted. It on June 30 decided to give approval to the USD 9-billion deal subject to Cairn/Vedanta allowing royalties from Cairn India's prize Rajasthan oil fields to be added to project costs and recovered from sales. Also, it has to end arbitration proceedings against the government disputing its liability to pay cess, or tax, on its 70% share of oil from the fields. Third, the deal has to be approved by ONGC, which has a stake in all three of Cairn India's producing assets and five of its seven exploration assets, waiving its pre-emption rights. And finally, the acquisition needs security clearance. Accepting the royalty condition alone would mean about USD 900 million&amp;amp;nbsp;dent in revenues of Cairn India annually.  &amp;quot;At the time of writing this Management Discussion and Analysis, neither Cairn India nor its Board of Directors know what decisions might have been taken by the GoM, which are expected to subsequently flow to the Company as a note from the MoPNG via the CCEA. Whatever the outcome, the fact is that it has created considerable uncertainties,&amp;quot; the report said. &amp;quot;Since the Company has not yet received a letter from the MoPNG containing the CCEA's decisions, it is inappropriate to comment on its unsubstantiated contents,&amp;quot; it added. Cairn said the Rajasthan block has a potential to produce 240,000 bpd of crude, subject to approval of the regulatory authorities and partner, ONGC. Under Business Risk section, Cairn India said it &amp;quot;is and may become, involved in proceedings in relation to payment of royalty and cess for the production of crude oil from the Mangala field in Rajasthan.&amp;quot; Cairn India has a participating interest of 70% in the Rajasthan block (RJ-ON-90/1) and is also the operator. ONGC holds the remaining 30% stake. &amp;quot;Under the Production Sharing Contract executed for this block, in the view of Cairn India, royalty and cess are payable by ONGC as the licencee and these are not part of the contract cost for the purpose of cost recovery,&amp;quot; it said. ONGC has been paying royalty to the Rajasthan government for the crude production every month. However, ONGC has contended that the royalty payable under this PSC should be considered as a contract cost for cost recovery purposes. &amp;quot;However, to date, Cairn India has no formal intimation from Government of India or ONGC of any dispute, demand or allegation of royalty being part of contract cost for cost recovery purpose. Cairn India has secured legal opinions in its favour and believes that it has a strong case,&amp;quot; the report said. Cairn India has initiated arbitration proceedings against the government and ONGC pursuant to a claim notice seeking Cairn India to pay cess on oil produced from the Rajasthan block to the extent of the company's participating interest in the block. &amp;quot;In the event that royalty is considered to be part of contract cost for cost recovery or Cairn India is held liable to pay its 70% share of cess, there would be a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations,&amp;quot; the annual report added.

2011-07-19T14:08:45+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,ONGC holds back consent for Cairn India restructuring,"In signs of a souring relationship, state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has withheld consent for internal restructuring of Cairn India Ltd for the past one year.","In signs of a souring relationship, state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has withheld consent for internal restructuring of Cairn India Ltd for the past one year. Cairn wants the stakes that its different subsidiaries, including some registered abroad, hold in various oil and gas properties, including the showpiece Rajasthan oilfields, to be transfered into one India-based company. Since ONGC is partner in six of those properties, Cairn procedurally sought a no-objection from ONGC, but the state-run oil giant has so far not agreed to the proposal, sources privy to the development said. The restructuring is separate from London-listed mining group Vedanta Resources' USD 9 billion buyout of Cairn India. While the Vedanta deal, where Edinburgh-based Cairn Energy Plc is selling 40% of its interest in Cairn India, was announced in August, 2010, the restructuring began in 2009. When contacted, two top ONGC officials were not aware why the consent was withheld.&amp;amp;nbsp; Sources said the restructuring, which was approved by the board of Cairn India and boards of its subsidiaries in December, 2009, has no bearing on the Vedanta deal. In December, 2009, itself, Cairn got no-objection certificates for the restructuring from the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), where it is listed, and the company's shareholders approved the scheme in February, 2010. In April last year, the Chennai High Courtapproved the scheme of restructuring and the Bombay High Court sanctioned the scheme in June, 2010.&amp;amp;nbsp; But ONGC, which holds up to 90% interest in the Cairn properties, has not given its no-objection certificate yet, they said. Cairn wants the interest held by its unit, Cairn Energy India Ltd, and other group companies in six assets to be transferred to Cairn India Ltd. The objective behind this exercise is to bring the Indian oil and gas exploration and production business of some of its group firms incorporated abroad directly into Cairn India.&amp;amp;nbsp; Cairn India, spun off from Cairn Energy Plc, listed on the Indian stock exchanges on January 9, 2007, although a number of its Indian assets were still held by overseas subsidiaries. The restructuring proposed would do away with the existing multi-layered structure, involving various foreign subsidiaries and Cairn India Ltd, which is avoidable and administratively burdensome. Cairn said the proposed scheme and assignment of participating interest would have no impact on any of its joint venture partners in the relevant blocks as the process was merely an internal reorganisation and there is no third party involved.  Half of Cairn's 70% interest in the Rajasthan block is held by its subsidiary, Cairn Energy India Pty Ltd. The same subsidiary also holds its 22.5% interest in the eastern offshore oil and gas producing Ravva field.&amp;amp;nbsp; Its 40% interest in Cambay basin CB/OS-2 block is held through Cairn Energy Pty Ltd (6.7%), Cairn Energy India West BV (13.2%), Cairn Energy Gujarat BV (10%) and Cairn Energy Cambay BV (10%).&amp;amp;nbsp; Cairn Energy India Pty Ltd also holds interests in three exploration blocks. The restructuring would become effective once all the requisite approvals are obtained. Cairn requires a no-objection certificate and a board resolution approving the change in operatorship from all joint venture partners. Its other joint venture partners -- Videocon, Ravva Oil Singapore and Tata Petrodyne -- have completed the necessary formalities and only ONGC's response is awaited, sources said.","BSE, Business, Cairn India Ltd, NSE, Oil and Natural Gas Corp, Rajasthan oilfields, Vedanta Resources","BSE, Business, Cairn India Ltd, NSE, Oil and Natural Gas Corp, Rajasthan oilfields, Vedanta Resources",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-holds-back-consent-for-cairn-india-restructuring_566776.html

Reliance had in 2004 proposed a USD 2.4 billion investment for producing 40 million cubic metres per day of gas from 5.32 trillion cubic feet of reserves in the D1/D3 fields of the KG-D6 block.  Also Read: Morgan Stanley reduces RIL target to Rs 956; stock down Later, in 2006, it revised the capital expenditure requirement to USD 5.2 billion in Phase-I for producing a higher 80 mmscmd of gas from 11.3 tcf of reserves. Replying to a draft audit report of the CAG, which said that the increase in field cost would mean a lower profit take for the government, Reliance said, &amp;quot;It has set a benchmark for the lowest project costs across the world.&amp;quot; Its cost estimates for producing gas from the deepsea KG-D6 block are the lowest even in comparison to shallow water projects. &amp;quot;Oil and Natural Gas Corp's block KG-D5 in vicinity, with a discovery made in 2001, has 1.9 tcf of gas reserves with an estimated development cost of USD 7.7 billion, for which a development plan is under preparation. &amp;quot;Gujarat State Petroleum Corp's (GSPC) shallow water block in the same basin, which had a discovery in 2003, is estimated to cost USD 2 billion to develop 1.4 tcf,&amp;quot; it said.  ONGC's KG-D5 block sits next to Reliance's KG-D6 area, where the first discovery was made in 2002. While Reliance took six years to bring KG-D6 gas on to production, even after 10 years of the first discovery, ONGC has not yet been able to put together a development plan. Reliance said the allegations that government revenue interests have been affected by the 'gold-plating' are completely false. The New Exploration Licencing Policy, under which Reliance had won the KG-D6 block in 2000, brought an end to the 'cost plus regime', where firms got a fixed return on all the capital they invested. Under NELP, a contractor like Reliance &amp;quot;never benefits by an increase in costs,&amp;quot; it said, adding it was imperative to view the revenue interest of the government from the point of view of the contribution of the project to the nation. &amp;quot;Needless to say, inspite of all the noise, the draft CAG report has found nothing to suggest that Reliance indulged in 'gold-plating' viz that Reliance placed orders on its own affiliates at inflated costs or that payments made to vendors came back to Reliance,&amp;quot; the voluminous 250-page response said. After an extensive and detailed audit process, in which eight CAG officials spent six months on Reliance premises, &amp;quot;CAG does not state that any evidence exists to support any case that the contract cost has been dishonestly inflated.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Using the benefit of hindsight, the CAG cannot question the technical and operational judgements of the operator that were in effect the best possible judgements at the time, based on the best information available,&amp;quot; it added.","Business, GSPC, KG-D6, ONGC, Reliance Industries","Business, GSPC, KG-D6, ONGC, Reliance Industries",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/reliance-says-kg-d6-cost-lower-than-gspc-ongc-projects_565882.html

Vedanta acquired 191.92 million equity shares of Cairn India at Rs 355 per share. The total cash payout worked out to Rs 6,813.16 crore. While Vedanta's statement put the acquisition price at USD 1.505 billion, Cairn Energy in a separate statement put it at USD 1.36 billion. The difference may be due to the different exchange rates the two companies may have taken.&amp;amp;nbsp; Following the purchase of 191,920,207 shares yesterday, Vedanta upped its stake in Cairn India to 28.5%.&amp;amp;nbsp; Cairn Energy will sell another 30% of its interest in Cairn India &amp;quot;subject to the necessary consents and approvals from the government of India,&amp;quot; the UK-based firm said. &amp;quot;Vedanta continues to work with Cairn Energy to secure the necessary consents to complete the purchase of a further 30% of the fully diluted share capital of Cairn India and a further announcement will be made in due course,&amp;quot; a Vedanta statement said. After this sale, Cairn Energy remains the majority shareholder of Cairn India with a 52.2&amp;amp;nbsp;%&amp;amp;nbsp;shareholding. Vedanta had in August last year agreed to buy a 40 to 51% stake in Cairn India, but later lowered the shares it intended to buy to just 40%. It was to pay Cairn Energy Rs 405 per share, including a Rs 50 per share non-compete fee.&amp;amp;nbsp; But government held back its approval as it wanted Cairn to settle long-pending issues of royalty payment with state-run explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp&amp;amp;nbsp;and a tax arbitration case against the government. Sensing the mood, Cairn Energy late last month decided to forego Rs 50 per share apparently to make up for the loss of revenue Cairn India may face if the government conditions on royalty and cess payments are accepted. Cairn India's profit take from its prize Rajasthan oil fields will fall by USD 1.68 billion in case the riders imposed by the government for approving its parent Cairn Energy's stake sale to Vedanta Resources are accepted. The Cabinet had on June 30 approved the deal subject to Cairn Energy or its successor agreeing to cost recovery of royalty in the Rajasthan fields. Also, Cairn has to agree to pay cess on its 70% share of production from the fields. Sources said while Cairn India will not have to pay any royalty and state-owned ONGC will continue to pay royalty on its behalf to the state government, the levy will be added to the project costs, which are first deducted from oil sale revenues before profits are split between the partners and the government.

Coal India Ltd (CIL) fell sharply on heavy sell-offs in metals and mining firms after the Centre cleared a draft bill proposing that they share profits with the people displaced by their projects or pay them royalty.  CIL valuation dipped Rs 13,927.58 crore to Rs 2,28,652.23 crore, pulling it down to the fourth position from the second after Reliance Industries as on July 1. ONGC sailed past TCS, which was at the third position, to capture the CIL spot in the overall ranking as of last Friday.  CIL was also the biggest loser among the country's top-10 firms. It tanked nearly 6% during the week to end at Rs 362. On Friday alone, the scrip plunged 8.12%.  Last week, a ministerial panel, headed by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee , approved the proposed Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Bill, 2011, according to which coal miners would have to share 26 per cent of their profits and non-coal miners will have to pay 100% royalty to the projects-affected people.

CNBC-TV18 learns that at the management committee meeting for the Rajasthan block held on the June 10, the oil ministry did not approve the FY12 production rate, work programme and budget for Bhagyam fields.  Cairn India is scheduled to start producing 40,000 barrels per day from Bhagyam in the second half of FY12, and sources say the company now fears this development may result in Cairn India's FY12 production being capped at 135,000 bpd per day versus its target of 175,000 bpd.  The oil ministry wants all prior entitlement issues to be resolved before giving it a go ahead to start production from Bhagyam. Cairn India has written to the oil ministry asking it to delink the entitlement interest issue from production, and that this production of 40,000 bpd is in the best interests of all stakeholders and the nation at a time when crude is being imported at a exorbitantly high price.  ONGC, which has a 30% participatory interest in the block and has been at loggerheads with Cairn over royalty, says it will agree to production commencing from Bhagyam but only if an expert first reviews the facilities.  Cairn India, in a response says, it's on track to start production from Bhagyam in the second half of the fiscal.","Bhagyam, Business, Cairn India, ONGC","Bhagyam, Business, Cairn India, ONGC",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/now-cairn-india-govt-spat-over-bhagyam-production_563558.html

As this is the first offshore block of the PSU in the Krishna-Godavari basin being put into production, it is apt for Prime Minister to inaugurate the facility, a senior official, who did not want to be quoted, said. &amp;quot;As the first offshore block of the country, Mumbai High in the West Coast was inaugurated by then PM Indira Gandhi, we want the present PM Manmohan Singh to inaugurate the East Coast offshore field,&amp;quot; the official said. With the new facility, the initial production of gas is set to touch two million standard cubic meters (SCM) and that of associated oil to 9,400 barrels per day, sources said. The oil and natural gas major, which has 24 blocks in the basin, currently produces 840 tonnes of oil per day and 3.8 MMSCD of gas from its onshore blocks. While, the G1 is located 28 kms off Amalapuram coast in water depths ranging from 135 to 500 meters, the GS 15, in shallow waters, is located at 5 kms from the coast in KG basin. The project is almost five years behind schedule with the cost overruns following delay on part of the Australian contractor Clough Engineering who eventually quit the project. The production of the gas was originally scheduled to start from the integrated field way back in April 2006, at an estimated cost of Rs 1,200 crore. Leighton India had been awarded a USD 17 million contract for completion of the offshore installations.

2011-07-04T14:38:46+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,Cairn India may have to be bulldosed to accept govt norms,UK's Cairn Energy or its successor Vedanta Resources may have to bulldose Cairn India board if they were to accept conditions set by the government to clear their USD 9-billion deal.,"UK's Cairn Energy or its successor Vedanta Resources may have to bulldose Cairn India board if they were to accept conditions set by the government to clear their USD 9-billion deal. The board of Cairn India (CIL) has on two occasions rejected oil ministry conditions that royalties paid by ONGC on its all important Rajasthan oilfields, be cost recoverable from oil sales saying this was against contractual provisions and not in the interest of the company and its shareholders. Also, CIL is against Rs 2,500 per tonne cess being imposed on it saying contractually ONGC, like in case of royalty, is responsible for payment of the levy. Cost recovery of royalty and payment of cess are preconditions Cabinet set last week for approving Cairn Energy selling sake in CIL to Vedanta. But now if the its parent (Cairn Energy) or Vedanta were to accept these condition, a serious corporate governance issue will arise for CIL, analysts tracking the deal said. &amp;quot;Can CIL compromise other shareholders' interest just because one shareholder (Cairn Energy) is selling its stake to other (Vedanta),&amp;quot; one of them asked. &amp;quot;I think there is a larger corporate governance issue involved. It is true that it is a corporate transaction involving share transfer between two entities. But can someone sell a majority stake in a company without taking that companyinto confidence,&amp;quot; another person asked. Accepting the royalty condition alone would mean about USD 900 million dent in revenues of Cairn India annually, they said, adding either Cairn Energy will have to convince CIL board into accepting the conditions or Vedanta when it takesover the company overrule the board. Cairn Energy had publicly voiced concern over both the preconditions and Vedanta opposed them in a January 28 letter to the then Oil Secretary S Sundareshan. Stating that acceptance of the conditions could be challenged by CIL's minority shareholders under provisions of the Companies Act, Vedanta CEO M S Mehta wrote Vedanta would become just a shareholder of CIL after completion of the deal. &amp;quot;CIL and its subsidiaries are the signatories to and counterparties to the various Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) entered into the Government of India. As Vedanta would not be a party to any of these contracts, and would be merely a shareholdes of CIL, it would be neither possible nor appropriate for Vedanta to agree to any conditions which directly impacs their terms - particularly as this impacts the rights of minority shareholders,&amp;quot; he wrote. Emphasing that CIL was an independently run listed entity with an independent board that was duty bound to act in the interests of all shareholders, he said the riders &amp;quot;would involve a significant departure from the terms of the existing contracts entered into by CIL and government.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;We also understand that these (conditions) would have a material adverse impact on CIL's value and thus negatively impact the interests of all shareholders, including the minority shareholders. Acceptance of any of these proposals is likely to be challenged by CIL's minority shareholders under the provisions of the Companies Act. As such, you will kindly appreciate that we are not in a position to accept these,&amp;quot; Vedanta Resources CEO M S Mehta wrote in the two-page letter. Analysts said if Vedanta accepts the government preconditions, then it will have to overrule the board of Cairn India and make it do a U-turn into accepting them. While an e-mail sent to Vedanta remained unanswered, Cairn India spokesperson was unavailable for comments. Cairn Energy has always maintained that it is just a shareholder in CIL and the expertise, skills and management vests in Cairn India. So can the UK firm or its successor impose conditions which are detrimental to Cairn India'sinterest, an analyst asked. Another analyst said minority shareholders can take the board of directors of Cairn India to court for jeopardising their interest by compromising on their interest.Of the four independent directors on Cairn India, two of them have conflict of interest (they are also on the board of Vedanta Resources). It is now the job of the independent directors to protect minority shareholders' interest. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had last week decided to give approval to the USD 9-billion deal subject to Cairn/Vedanta allowing royalties from Cairn India's prize Rajasthan oil fields to be added to project costs andrecovered from sales. Also, it has to end arbitration proceedings against the government disputing its liability to pay cess, or tax, on its 70% share of oil from the fields. Third, the deal has to be approved by state Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), which has a stake in all three of Cairn India's producing assets and five of its seven exploration assets, waiving its pre-emption rights. And finally, the acquisition needs security clearance. Cairn Enegy is selling 40% stake in Cairn India to Vedanta. Sources said while Cairn India will not have to pay any royalty and state-owned ONGC will continue to pay royalty on its behalf to the state government but the levy will be addedto project costs that is first deducted from oil sale revenues before profits are split between partners and the government. Acceptance of this condition by Edinburgh-based Cairn Energy or its successor London-listed miner Vedanta will lower Cairn India's profit over the approved life of the life lasting 2020 from USD 7.43 billion to USD 5.75 billion. Sources said the lower profits have been calculated at approved peak output of 175,000 barrels a day and considering a crude oil price of USD 70 per barrel.  Cairn also has to agree to ending arbitration proceedings against the government disputing its liability to pay cess, or tax, on its 70% share of oil from the Rajasthan fields. Cairn India currently pays Rs 2,626.5 per tonne cess under protest but unlike royalty, treats it as a cost recoverable item. The government take from the RJ-ON-90/1 block will come down to USD 3.6 billion from USD 5.188 billion as a result of royalty being made cost recoverable, sources said. Also, the deal has to be approved by state Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), which has a stake in all three of Cairn India's producing assets and five of its seven exploration assets, waiving its pre-emption rights. And finally, the acquisition will need security clearance. ONGC pays royalty on its 30% share of oil from Rajasthan fields as well as on operator Cairn India's 70% take. It will contractually continue to pay royalty on all the oil produced from Rajasthan but this will be added to project cost, which is first deducted from revenues earned from sale of oil before profits are split between partners. Cairn last week cut the price it was demanding from Vedanta and removed a noncompete condition. Vedanta will now pay USD 6.02 billion for a 40 per cent stake in Cairn India at a reduced price of Rs 355 per share, down from the original USD 6.84 billion. Last August, London-listed, India-focused miner Vedanta proposed to buy 51 to 60 per cent of oil and gas explorer Cairn India for up to USD 9.6 billion in cash, but the deal has been delayed due to a lack of government and regulatory approvals. Even before Vedanta made its move, ONGC had demanded that royalties be added to costs and recouped through sales, citing provisions in its contract. After the deal was announced, it maintained it had pre-emption rights and that the acquisition could not go ahead without its agreement. The CCEA last week overruled objections to ONGC's demand by Cairn/Vedanta and held these will have to be met before the approval is granted. Both Cairn and Vedanta disputed royalty being made cost recoverable as it would dent Cairn India profits. They also opposed the need for partner consent for the transaction. Vedanta has steadily built a position in Cairn Energy this year by acquiring a 10.4% stake from Malaysia's Petroliam Nasional Berhad, or Petronas for USD 1.47 billion (Rs 331 a share). It also bought 8.1% stake through Sesa Goa's open offer to shareholders, which closed on April 30, for USD 1.2 billion. The open offer was made at Rs 355 per share (original acquisition price of Rs 405 minus Rs 50 per share non-compete fee).

Oil and gas producers like ONGC have to make good one-third of the revenues that retailers lose on selling diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene at government-controlled rates. ONGC gives discounts to IOC, BPCL and HPCL on crude oil it sells to them to make up for losses on fuel sales. &amp;quot;The upstream companies' share of under-recoveries (revenue loss) has been increased from one-third (33.33%) to 38.75% for the year 2010-11 and 46.89% for Q4 of FY-11,&amp;quot; ONGC Chairman and Managing Director A K Hazarika wrote to Oil Secretary G C Chaturvedi. As a result, ONGC's net realisation on crude oil sales translated into just USD 38.75 per barrel, the lowest in the last eight quarters, he said. &amp;quot;It has not only adversely affected our profits and cash flows, but also investor sentiment, reflected in fall in market capitalisation from Rs 265,520 crore to Rs 228,860 crore, i.e. by 14%.&amp;quot; Hazarika said ONGC should get a net crude price of USD 58-60 per barrel to meet its planned capital investments of Rs 30,000 crore and so, the upstream companies' share should be just 25% if crude oil prices rise above the USD 100 per barrel mark. Upstream firms ONGC, Oil India and GAIL India should be asked to bear one-third of under-recoveries if crude oil stays under USD 70 per barrel. But if it touches USD 75 a barrel, their share should come down to 30%. This share should progressively fall to 25% if crude touches USD 100. &amp;quot;If the formula of one-third under-recovery being passed on to upstream companies during the year 2011-12 when the crude prices are likely to remain over USD 100 per barrel is continued, this would have serious impact on the profitability and cash flows of upstream companies,&amp;quot; he wrote. Upstream firms contributed Rs 30,297 crore out of the total revenue loss of Rs 78,189 crore in the 2010-11 fiscal. Of this, ONGC's share was Rs 24,892 crore. In a detailed 11-page note plus four annexures, Hazarika said ONGC's net price realisation will be USD 37.95 per barrel if one-third of the Rs 206,816 crore revenue loss arising at the USD 120 a barrel crude price is to be borne by upstream firms. At a USD 100 per barrel crude price, the upstream share will be Rs 45,150 crore, of which ONGC will have to chip in Rs 37,096 crore and its net crude price realisation will be USD 46.26 per barrel. Alternatively, he suggested that the government impose a special oil tax or windfall tax to take 20-80% ofincremental revenues accruing over and above the crude oil price of USD 60 per barrel. Hazarika said for every dollar hike in crude oil prices, the increase in under-recovery or revenue loss is Rs 3,440 crore. Of this, the upstream share is Rs 1,146.67 crore according to the one-third subsidy sharing formula. ONGC contributes 82.16% of the upstream share. Hazarika said the levy of a special oil tax has been recommended by expert committees headed by B K Chaturvedi in June, 2008, and by Kirit S Parikh in August, 2009. &amp;quot;Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas is requested to notify a fair and transparent mechanism for sharing of under- recoveries, wherein under-recoveries of oil marketing companies are allocated among all parties in such a manner that a part of increase in crude price is retained by upstream oil companies to meet increased cost of production and to meet existing and future plans and obligations,&amp;quot; Hazarika wrote.","BPCL, Business, diesel, domestic LPG, fuel, HPCL, IOC, kerosene, Oil and Natural Gas Corp","BPCL, Business, diesel, domestic LPG, fuel, HPCL, IOC, kerosene, Oil and Natural Gas Corp",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ad-hoc-subsidy-sharing-hurts-profitability-cash-flow-ongc_561555.html

The USD 9-billion transaction is listed as the second item on the agenda of CCEA that will meet on 1645 hours on Thursday, a source privy to the development said. As of now, the CCEA has just two items listed for discussion. As if in preparation for the nod which will come with conditions attached, the Edinburgh-based energy explorer yesterday announced lowering of the price at which it will sell 40% stake in Cairn India to Vedanta by over Rs3,800 crore. A Group of Ministers headed by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee had on May 27 recommended that the government nod be given to the transaction only if Cairn or its successor agrees to bear a portion of royalty payable on its mainstay Rajasthan oil fields. If imposed, these conditions will materially affect the deal and Cairn/Vedanta by agreeing to lower the sale price appears to be headed towards accepting them. Cairn Energy will sell its 40% stake in Cairn India to Vedanta at Rs 355 per share instead of Rs 405 a share agreed in August last year. It will now get gross proceeds of Rs 27,007 crore (about USD 6.02 billion) instead of Rs 30,811 crore (USD 6.84 billion) it was initially expecting. The Scottish explorer has for the past 10 months denied the need for government approval to what it called a corporate transaction. It also rejected both the requirement of nod and pre-emption of partner Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), which holds stake in 8 out of 10 properties of Cairn India,including the crown-jewel Rajasthan block. Besides agreeing to take partner consent, Cairn and its successor have to agree to making royalty ONGC pays on entire crude output from Rajasthan despite owning only 30%, as recoverable from sale of oil, the source said. ONGC had cited provisions of the contract months before the Cairn-Vedanta deal was announced, to demand that royalty be made cost recoverable. GoM wanted the 20% royalty paid on Rajasthan crude be made cost recoverable and Cairn India agree to pay Rs 2,500 per tonne cess on its 70% share in Rajasthan as preconditions for the government consent for the deal. Both the conditions had material impact on the deal and Cairn Energy's announcement yesterday that it is willing to forego Rs 50 per share non-compete fee it was charging from Vedanta, indicated its willingness to accept these conditionsfor the sake of the deal. ONGC owns 30% in the Rajasthan oilfields, but has to pay royalty at the rate of 20% of the crude oil price realised on all of the 240,000 barrels per day of peak output expected from the fields. At a USD 70 per barrel oil price, it has to pay Rs 12,600 crore in royalties on Cairn India's behalf over the life of the field, making India's largest onland fields a losing proposition for it. ONGC had cited provisions in the contract for Rajasthan oilfields in July last year to demand that royalty like other taxes and levies should first be deducted (recovered) from the sale proceeds of oil before the profits were split between partners and the government. Cairn as well as Vedanta had opposed ONGC's demand.&amp;amp;nbsp;Sources said Cairn has also disputed its liability to pay oil cess at the rate of Rs 2,500 per tonne on its 70% share in the Rajasthan fields, saying ONGC is also liable to pay cess on its behalf, like in the case of royalty. The government has rejected this position as the contract imposes the royalty liability on ONGC, but is silent on cess. Sources said the GoM recommended that Cairn withdraw the cess arbitration and agree to pay its share of cess as the second pre-condition for approval. Also, the company will have to obtain a no-objection certificate from ONGC for transferring ownership to Vedanta. For the seven exploration blocks or areas Cairn had won under the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP), the GoM held that the PSC provision of seeking partner consent must be met. ONGC is a partner in five of these blocks, they said. In case of CB-OS/2 and the Ravva oil and gas fields in the Eastern Offshore -- the other producing properties of Cairn -- the GoM suggested the government nod should be subject to Vedanta providing performance and financialguarantees. Also, Vedanta will need security clearance from the Ministry of Home Affairs, sources said. Cairn Energy, which currently owns 62.1% in Cairn India, was charging Rs 50 per share as fee for staying away from India and other neighbouring countries for three years. With the removal of the non-compete fee, &amp;quot;gross proceeds for the sale of a 40% interest in Cairn India will amount to USD 6.023 billion with net proceeds (after payment of taxes) is expected to be about USD 5.408 billion in cash,&amp;quot; Cairn and Vedanta had said in identical statements yesterday. Cairn said the transaction will now take place in two tranches: Cairn Energy will sell 10% out of its 62.2% stake in Cairn India by July 11 and another 30% upon receipt of the government approval.

2011-06-28T18:05:21+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,Vedanta move to increase Cairn stake fuels optimism,Shares in Vedanta Resources and Cairn Energy climbed on Tuesday after analysts said moves to increase the miner's stake in Cairn's Indian assets and to cut the price of a long-pending deal signalled the two were edging closer to a solution.,"Shares in Vedanta Resources and Cairn Energy climbed on Tuesday after analysts said moves to increase the miner's stake in Cairn's Indian assets and to cut the price of a long-pending deal signalled the two were edging closer to a solution. Cairn Energy agreed last August to sell a majority stake in Cairn India to Vedanta in a deal that was valued at up to USD 9.6 billion. But the sale, which would be one of the largest in India's energy sector, has been delayed due to a disagreement over royalty payments. India's oil ministry has been pushing for Cairn India to share royalty payments with state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp, which has a 30%holding in the Cairn-operated fields in western India but pays 100% of the royalties. &amp;quot;The Indian government, Vedanta and Cairn appear to be getting closer and closer to some sort of agreement,&amp;quot; Charles Cooper at Oriel Securities in London said on Tuesday. Analysts said changes to the deal -- and in particular a decision to remove a non-compete fee that cuts the price of a 40% stake in Cairn India by more than USD 600 million - indicated Vedanta and Cairn were closer to agreeing to India's demand that royalty payments be shared. &amp;quot;In particular, we believe they signal that Vedanta is willing to accept new, expected government conditions, which removes an important roadblock that has so far prevented Cairn from realising the value of Cairn India,&amp;quot; Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note. Shares in Vedanta and Cairn climbed over 2% in early trade on Tuesday, outperforming the market. Vedanta was up 2% at 1,943 pence at 1115 GMT, while Cairn was up 1.7%, against a 0.4% rise in the FTSE index. Vedanta said its increased stake in Cairn India indicated its commitment to the deal, but the larger share also provides protection in what could be a long process. By taking its stake over 20%, Vedanta can now include its equity stake in Cairn India in its accounts, even if it has to wait to obtain the remaining 30% - potentially fighting any royalty decision through the courts. &amp;quot;The fact that Vedanta will have nearly a third of Cairn India after buying 10 percent more by next month, they won't be desperate for the government's approval for the remaining 30% stake to take controlling stake,&amp;quot; said Jagannadham Thunuguntla, head of research at SMC Global in New Delhi.  Vedanta already has an 18.5% stake in Cairn India from an open offer and from Malaysia's Petronas. It will increase that to 28.5% by July 11.  Cairn India shares down Shares in Cairn India, however, have fallen nearly 13% since the announcement of the deal. The stock slipped over 2% on Tuesday, as investors worried about loss of revenue due to royalty payments. Goldman Sachs said the lack of clarity over the issue of royalty payments would remain an overhang for the stock, while the lack of a clear parent company would also weigh. The Indian government has given no timetable for its decision on the deal. An Indian ministerial panel has referred it back to the Indian cabinet with a recommendation, but that recommendation has not been made public. A government source told Reuters the panel would recommend the operators of Cairn Energy's key Indian oil field share the royalty burden in proportion to their stake in the project. The cabinet has been expected to meet to decide on the deal, but the meeting has been delayed over the past few weeks. &amp;quot;They (Cairn, Vedanta) must be aware of the outcomes being discussed by the Group of Ministers, and are trying to be proactive,&amp;quot; said Deepak Pareek, oil &amp;amp;amp; gas analyst at brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher. Analysts have estimated the impact of royalty-sharing at 65 to 70 rupees a share, but crude oil prices have moved up since the deal was signed last August. On the Cairn Energy side, analysts said the removal of the non-compete clause would mean a reduction of only just over 5% in post-tax proceeds - a small price to pay for cash upfront which will help fund its exploration needs.","Business, Cairn Energy, Cairn India, Oil and Natural Gas Corp, Vedanta Resources","Business, Cairn Energy, Cairn India, Oil and Natural Gas Corp, Vedanta Resources",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/vedanta-move-to-increase-cairn-stake-fuels-optimism_560931.html

2011-06-27T15:00:26+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,GAIL seeks exemption from payment of fuel subsidies,State-run gas utility GAIL India today said it should be exempted from payment of fuel subsidies as it does not get any upside from rise in crude oil or natural gas price.,"State-run gas utility GAIL India today said it should be exempted from payment of fuel subsidies as it does not get any upside from rise in crude oil or natural gas price. GAIL along with Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) have to compensate for at least one third of the revenue that fuel retailers lose on selling auto and cooking fuel at the government controlled rates. &amp;quot;We have been saying that GAIL should be out of subsidy sharing mechanism as unlike oil and gas producer, we do not get any incremental revenue on increase in oil and gas price,&amp;quot; GAIL Chairman and Managing Director B C Tripathi told reporters here. Upstream firms contributed Rs 30,297 crore or 38.75% of the total revenue loss of Rs 78,189 crore in 2010-11 fiscal. GAIL's share in this was Rs 2,111 crore or 6.97% of the total upstream share. ONGC, whose revenue increases with rise in crude oilprices, paid Rs 24,892 crore, or 82.16% of the upstream contribution, towards fuel subsidies. Tripathi said various government appointment committees, notably ones headed by Planning Commission Member B K Chaturvedi and Kirit Parikh, too, have opined that GAIL, which essentially is a gas transmission and marketing company, should be kept out of subsidy sharing mechanism. After the last week's government decision to raise diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene price together with customs and excise duty reductions to cut revenue loss of fuel retailers, he said GAIL's subsidy share during current fiscal is likely to come down to 2009-10 levels. In 2009-10, GAIL paid a subsidy of Rs 1,327 crore. This was 9.20%of the total upstream contribution of Rs 14,430 crore. In that year, upstream contribution was 31.33% of the total revenue loss of Rs 46,051 crore. During the first quarter of the current fiscal, upstream firms may have to chip in Rs 14,446 crore, roughly one-third of the retailers revenues. Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum lost on selling diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene below cost. Of this, ONGC may have to contribute Rs 12,123 crore, OIL Rs 1,640 crore and GAIL Rs 683 crore. Tripathi said GAIL will import at least one shipload of liquefied natural gas (LNG) every month to make up for fall in domestic gas output. &amp;quot;We have already tied up import of 2 cargoes in July.&amp;quot; Reliance Industries' eastern offshore KG-D6 field has seen output fall from 61.5 million standard cubic meters per day to less than 48 mmscmd. LNG costs about USD 12.5 per million British thermal unit, double the price of KG-D6 gas.","Business, GAIL India","Business, GAIL India",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/gail-seeks-exemptionpaymentfuel-subsidies_560484.html

The state-run explorer, which is in talks with Italy's Eni and BG to sell up to 30% in the block, believes its discoveries in the northern part of its deep water block are commercial, it said in a statement on Wednesday. &amp;quot;The proposal (for declaration of commerciality) is under consideration with the (upstream regulator),&amp;quot; the statement said, adding, &amp;quot;This is only a conceptual development plan and hence would be subject to wide variation&amp;quot;. ONGC plans to spend USD 7.7 billion on development of the block, in which Cairn India has a 10% stake. India needs gas to help power its electricity generation, fertiliser sector, city gas distribution and for industries. ONGC needs the expertise of foreign players to boost its local oil and gas output, as it struggles with declining production from its marginal and aged fields. Reliance Industries has just brought in BP to help it improve falling output at its D6 block in the same basin, known as Krishna Godavari. In the last financial year ending March 2011, ONGC's local oil output rose by 3% to 27.28 million tonnes and natural gas production declined 1.1% to 25.32 BCM. Analysts were cautious about the impact on ONGC's stock price, which rose 1.86% to 260.80 rupees (USD 5.816) on Wednesday in a flat market. The shares are still some way off their 2011 high of 325.65 rupees seen at the end of April. &amp;quot;This does not mean that discoveries are commercial. For developing the infrastructure in east coast ONGC would require a lot of freedom from the regulatory side,&amp;quot; said Deven Choksey, head of brokerage K R Choksey. An analyst with an international brokerage firm said it was too early to make any judgement on the estimates. &amp;quot;These are only initial estimates and these can go anywhere,&amp;quot; the analyst said, adding &amp;quot;There is not much exploration upside built in ONGC's stock prices as this time, so basically future discoveries or commerciality of existing discoveries do not contribute to the stock prices.&amp;quot; (USD 1 = Rs 44.845)","Business, D6, deep water block, The Oil and Natural Gas Corp","Business, D6, deep water block, The Oil and Natural Gas Corp",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-east-coast-block-gas-volumes-seen-at-357-tcf_559435.html

2011-06-22T14:07:48+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,ONGC overstated reserves in KG basin block: Cairn India,"State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) may have overstated the natural gas reserves in its much-talked about KG basin KG-DWN-98/2 block, which sits next to Reliance Industries' prolific KG-D6 fields.","State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) may have overstated the natural gas reserves in its much-talked about KG basin KG-DWN-98/2 block, which sits next to Reliance Industries' prolific KG-D6 fields. Cairn India, which had made four discoveries in the KG-DWN-98/2 block before selling 90% out of its 100% stake in the block to ONGC in 2005, has written to the oil regulator DGH saying the state-owned firm is grossly overstating the reserves in block, sources said. CCEA may mull giving nod to Cairn-Vedanta deal this week It believes that &amp;quot;the hither-to discovered oil and gas resources in the block are only marginal to non-commercial, because of their small size and the potential high development costs due to water depth versus the prevailing gas prices.&amp;quot; ONGC estimates that the blocks holds an in-place volume of 25.61 million tonnes of oil and 197 billion cubic metres of natural gas. It is proposing an investment of over USD 7.3 billion to produce up to 30 million standard cubic metres per day of gas. The warning by Cairn, which holds a 10% interest in the acreage and is credited with finding oil in an area in Rajasthan where global giant Royal Dutch/Shell exited saying there was no hydrocarbons, is significant in view of the fall in gas output from Reliance's neighbouring KG-D6 block. Reliance had in 2007 estimated that the Dhirubhai-1 and 3 fields in the KG-D6 block would hit 69 mmscmd of output, but production has fallen to 40 mmscmd due to what the Mukesh Ambani-led firm says are reservoir complexities. Cairn, which is recognised the world-over for its expertise in assessment of hydrocarbon resources, wants &amp;quot;a correct reserve estimation of the block through an independent agency.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The work undertaken (to assess reserves in the block) by Schlumberger Data and Consulting Services in 2007 (at the behest of ONGC) is flawed and they substantially over-estimated the resources in the block,&amp;quot; it wrote to DGH. Stating that it had on various occasions pointed out to the flaws, Cairn said, &amp;quot;It is imperative that a new study is undertaken by a third party of repute which enjoys the confidence of both ONGC and Cairn, such as DeGolyer &amp;amp;amp; MacNaughton, in order to establish a correct assessment of the resources, based on which the stakeholders would be able to take appropriate decisions.&amp;quot; Cairn said ONGC had submitted a proposal to declare some of the discoveries in the block as commercial, a step toward developing the finds, without keeping it informed. ONGC, it said, was submitting various proposals without prior approval of the Operating Committee -- an oversight body comprising representatives of both partners. Submission of proposals without OC approval is a violation of the Production Sharing Contract and Joint Operating Agreement. Cairn claims that an innovative production method has to be worked out for the block in discussion with the DGH and the Oil Ministry. It also questioned the basis on which ONGC is seeking an extension of the appraisal period, which was completed as per the provisions of the PSC. It has asked for re-submission of the Declarations of Commerciality for the discoveries made in the block as well. ONGC bought 90% interest in Block KG-DWN-98/2 from Cairn Energy India Ltd in 2005. Cairn still holds 10% in the block. Before selling most of its stake and giving away operatorship of the block, Cairn made four discoveries in the area -- Padmavati, Kanakdurga, N-1 and R-1 (Annapurna). Subsequently, ONGC made six significant discoveries -- E-1, A1, U1, W1, D-1/KT-1 and the first ultra-deepwater discovery UD-1 at a record depth of 2,841 metres. The block is divided into a Northern Discovery Area (NDA) and Southern Discovery Area (SDA). The NDA comprises discoveries like Padmawati, Kanadurga, D, E, U, A, while the ultra deepsea UD find lies in SDA. Even ONGC has acknowledged that the NDA discoveries are small to marginal and can not be developed on a standalone basis due to high deepwater development costs. Accordingly, it is proposing to develop the discoveries in an integrated cluster. Sources said the ONGC Declaration of Commerciality (DOC) of NDA on July 15, 2010, was submitted without OC approval and so was the DOC of SDA on December 21, 2009. The DGH, they said, wants a fresh proposal for DOC to be submitted by the operator after completion of the proposed appraisal drilling programme by July 16, 2013, in case of NDA and by December 22, 2012, in case of SDA, or by July 16, 2013, for both the NDA and SDA.","Business, Cairn India, KG-D6 fields, Oil and Natural Gas Corp, ONGC, Reliance Industries","Business, Cairn India, KG-D6 fields, Oil and Natural Gas Corp, ONGC, Reliance Industries",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-overstated-reserveskg-basin-block-cairn-india_559311.html

ONGC Chairman A.K. Hazarika said talks were continuing with Italian oil major Eni and BG Group only for the sale of up to 30% in the block off India's east coast. &amp;quot;We can go up to 30%. We haven't decided yet. It will be discussed by the board,&amp;quot; Hazarika told television channel ET NOW. Development of the block is expected to cost USD 7.7 billion, Hazarika said. Last year, the then head of exploration at ONGC, D. K. Pandey, said Exxon Mobil and BP were also eyeing stakes in the KG-DWN-98/2 block, from which Brazil's Petrobras and Norway's Statoil had already exited. In February, BP decided to team up with Reliance Industries, which operates the D6 field, for exploration in India and agreed to buy a 30% stake in 23 of its oil and gas blocks for USD 7.2 billion. &amp;quot;Exxon is no longer interested,&amp;quot; said an ONGC company official who did not wish to be identified. Foreign companies are often apprehensive about investment in India's oil and gas sector as bureaucratic delays and disputes can prove costly obstacles. BP and Reliance are still awaiting approval from the government for their deal.  ONGC is currently contesting royalty payments with Cairn India, delaying the latter's sale by its parent Cairn Energy to Vedanta Resources. The ONGC official said the company's deepwater block in Krishna Godavari basin has a potential to produce at least 87 billion cubic metres of gas cumulatively. He added gas production from the block is expected to begin four years after the company gets approval from the government for drilling eight additional wells. &amp;quot;We do not have clear approvals for drilling these additional wells,&amp;quot; the offical said, adding the entry of foreign players is linked to government approval for this additional drilling.

No such proposal was put up for cabinet,&amp;quot; ONGC Chairman AK Hazarika told Reuters. &amp;quot;This news is incorrect.&amp;quot; ONGC has long eyed a deal with Bashneft, a unit of telecoms-to-oil group Sistema as well as involvement in the Arctic fields of Trebs and Titov, as it seeks to broaden its oil and gas base in Russia, the world's top energy exporter. But a merger of Bashneft and RussNeft is a long way off. Last week, Sistema President Mikhail Shamolin said the company may consider merging Bashneft and RussNeft once the latter's debt falls below &amp;amp;#36;4 billion, but given current oil prices it may be a few years before that debt falls to the required level, the Interfax agency reported.  ONGC already has a stake in Russia's Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project in the Pacific, and in 2008 it acquired the Imperial Energy oil company in western Siberia.

Reliance, for long the darling of Indian investors, was briefly knocked off its four-year long perch as the country's most-valuable company in August -- first by state-run Coal India and then by Oil &amp;amp;amp; Natural Gas Corp -- before regaining it. TCS, part of the salt-to-software Tata conglomerate, is the first private-sector company to overtake Reliance in market value. Shares in Reliance, which owns the world's largest refinery complex, fell 2.7% on Friday to their lowest level since March 2009. The stock lost 34.5% in 2011, underperforming a 24.6% fall in the benchmark index. At Friday's close, Reliance was valued at about USD 42.7 billion, while TCS commanded a market value of USD 42.8 billion, despite its shares closing 0.4% lower. &amp;quot;This leadership game is becoming like a musical chair,&amp;quot; said Jagannadham Thunuguntla, head of research at SMC Global securities in New Delhi. &amp;quot;If the underperformance in Reliance shares continues, it will become difficult for them to regain the top position again.&amp;quot; Reliance's growth outlook has been marred by falling gas output from its huge KG D6 gas fields, off India's east coast, which has drawn criticism from the country's upstream regulator, investors and analysts. A USD 7.2 billion deal to sell a 30% stake in 23 oil and gas blocks to BP Plc struck earlier this year failed to impress shareholders, who are also looking for more clarity on the company's move to enter new areas such as retail and telecoms. &amp;quot;KG D6 has sort of become a drag,&amp;quot; Thunuguntla said. &amp;quot;And also, they have somehow got into a long-gestation trap in all their businesses -- be it oil and gas, retail or telecom.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;They are sitting on a huge cash pile and need to deploy it at the right place. Holding cash is again not good,&amp;quot; he said. TCS, which competes with companies such as Infosys Ltd and Wipro in providing software services to western clients, saw its share price jump nearly 12% in the December quarter, compared with a 6% drop in the benchmark index. TCS has shed 0.4% on the year. Global technology spending outlook remains uncertain with no easy fix seen to the euro zone sovereign debt crisis and concerns about the US economy, but a sharp fall in the Indian rupee helps these exporters who get most of their revenues in foreign currencies while bulk of their spends are in rupee.","Business, Coal India, most-valuable firm, Mukesh Ambani, Oil & Natural Gas Corp, Reliance Industries, Tata Consultancy Services","Business, Coal India, most-valuable firm, Mukesh Ambani, Oil &amp;amp;amp; Natural Gas Corp, Reliance Industries, Tata Consultancy Services",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/tcs-pips-reliance-to-become-indias-most-valuable-firm_642158.html

2011-11-18T16:41:46+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,Govt going ahead with OIL disinvestment: DoD Secy,Disinvestment Ministry today said it has received in-principle clearance from Petroleum Ministry and is going ahead with the sale of government equity in Oil India Ltd (OIL).,"Disinvestment Ministry today said it has received in-principle clearance from Petroleum Ministry and is going ahead with the sale of government equity in Oil India Ltd (OIL). &amp;quot;Correspondence was going on for last six months... We got Petroleum Ministry in-principle approval yesterday for disinvestment in OIL. We have to work out the details,&amp;quot; Disinvestment Secretary Mohammad Haleem Khan said today. The total shares that the government will sell in OIL is yet to be decided, he said, adding, &amp;quot;the process of inter-ministerial consultation is on.&amp;quot; The government owns 78.43% in OIL. OIL had in September 2009 hit the market with an initial public offer and had mopped up over Rs 4,900 crore.  As part of the IPO, the government offloaded its 10% equity, while company issued 11% fresh equity. Khan further said that the government has identified GAIL (India) Ltd as a possible candidate for stake sale. He, however, did not mention if the OIL and GAIL issue would be done in the current fiscal. The government aims to raise Rs 40,000 crore through the sale of stakes in state-run companies in the current fiscal, but it has so far been able to mop up only Rs 1,145 crore due to weak market conditions. Khan said the government would stick to the public offer route for stake sale in ONGC and BHEL, in which it plans to divest 5% stake. The disinvestment of BHEL is held up for want of adequate independent directors on board, while in case of ONGC some directors are retiring, an official in the finance ministry said. Clause 49 of the Sebi regulations mandates that half of the company's board should comprise independent directors. BHEL, which has already filed draft papers with Sebi for a Rs 4,000 crore follow on offer last month, needs two more independent directors on board. Besides, through disinvestment in blue-chip oil company ONGC the government aims to mop up about Rs 12,000 crore.  The official further said that the government is looking at other options, including private placement and buy back, to achieve the disinvestment target for the current fiscal. Under the buyback mode, the government can raise money by selling its equity in the company to the concerned PSU itself. The ministry is also considering asking cash rich PSUs to buyback shares.","BHEL, Business, Disinvestment Ministry, GAIL, Mohammad Haleem, Oil India Ltd, ONGC","BHEL, Business, Disinvestment Ministry, GAIL, Mohammad Haleem, Oil India Ltd, ONGC",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/govt-going-aheadoil-disinvestment-dod-secy_620333.html

ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Sudhir Vasudeva and other members of the Board of Directors inspected the Ankleshwar oilfield yesterday, they said. ONGC struck oil at `Vasundhara', the first well of the company at Ankleshwar, in May 1960. In mid 1980s, another oil and gas field was discovered by the company in Gandhar.  The oilfields at Ankleshwar and Gandhar account for 25 per cent of total onshore production of the country. However, production from the existing oil and gas wells had been declining over the years, the sources said. The company now wants to spend this amount (Rs 2,200 crore), which has been approved by the Board of Directors, for increasing output from the two oilfields, they said. &amp;quot;ONGC is deploying latest technologies in collaboration with global players to achieve its goal.&amp;quot;  The public sector undertaking is also focusing on the east cost. &amp;quot;Efforts are being made to step up production from Andhra Pradesh on east coast.

Recently, company director UN Bose had reviewed the progress of activities and visited the Palatana project site. The company has set a target to produce six million metric standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd) of gas by 2012, to&amp;amp;nbsp;meet the requirements of the project and has also decided to drill two more gas well within the stipulated time (2012). Last year, ONGC had discovered two major gas wells. ONGC-Tripura Power Corporation (OTPC) is trying to install heavy equipments for the 726 MW mega thermal power plant at Palatana despite heavy rains and communication bottlenecks, sources said. Two makeshift bridges, commonly known as bypass, which were built on the rivers Hawra in Agartala and Gomati in South Tripura district, were washed away due to heavy rains last week, creating bottlenecks for transportation of the turbines and heavy equipments to the project site. Due to the collapse of the bridges, transportation of 280 tonne turbine has became difficult but ONGC is trying to rebuild the bridges before the monsoon sets in, in order to start generation by the end of December 2012, sources said. The initially estimated project cost of nearly Rs 8,000 crore has already gone up to Rs 9,000 crore because of the delay, sources added.

A consortium led by Swiber Offshore company has moved the apex court against a high court order that set aside the contract awarded by ONGC to it on grounds that oil and gas major acted in an arbitrary manner. A vacation bench of justices B S Chauhan and Swatanter Kumar said as the matter was important, prayer filed by Singapore-based offshore construction major Swiber Offshorecompany and Punj Llyod would be heard after the court resumes its work in the first week of July. &amp;quot;Keeping in view the urgency in the matter, we consider it appropriate to direct the listing of these matters for final disposal in the first week of July 2011. Till the next date, the interim order as passed by the High Court shall continue,&amp;quot; the bench said. The high court had on April 6 set aside ONGC's decision to award the contract to a consortium led by Swiber Offshore company along with Sime Darby of Malaysia. The apex court was hearing a petition filed by the Swiber Offshore challenging the high court's order. The court has already clarified that Swiber Offshore Construction could continue its work on the project that it started from March. The Singapore-based joint venture, however, would not claim any equity on the work done by it after the court verdict, the court had said. ONGC had floated USD 125 million tender for laying a 116.5 km sub-sea pipeline off the western coast of India, which was awarded to the Singapore-based firm. However, the decision was challenged by other bidders, including Punj Lloyd Ltd in the high court. They contended that while awarding the tender, ONGC had ignored some benefits offered by them on price preference. Major infra companies like L&amp;amp;amp;T, Punj Lloyd and Leighton had also participated in the bidding. While setting aside the tender, the high court had said that the manner of awarding the contract was &amp;quot;totally unacceptable and arbitrary&amp;quot; and the PSU had declined the price preference to Punj Lloyd merely on grounds of non submission of a statutory auditor's certificate in the bid documents. Swiber was the lowest bidder at USD 124.86 million, while Punj Lloyd had made a bid at USD 131.32 million. As per the terms and conditions of the bid, Indian firms were to submit auditor's certificate along with their price bids in a specific folder in order to take advantage of price preference. They were to be given 10% price advantage over foreign firms, provided they executed more than 50% of the project themselves.","Business, ONGC, Punj Llyod","Business, ONGC, Punj Llyod",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sc-to-decideongcs-36125-m-pipeline-bid-rowjuly_555461.html

Sen, a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Petroleum and Natural Gas and Committee on Public Undertakings (COPU), on June 3 wrote to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh saying the valuations ONGC used to justify not exercising its preemption rights were &amp;quot;totally opaque.&amp;quot; The Rajasthan fields are currently producing 125,000 barrels of crude oil per day and will reach 240,000 bpd (12 million tonnes a year) output in one years' time. ONGC, having a 30% interest in the fields, has the first right of refusal or preemption rights which are triggered by Cairn India's parent company Cairn Energy Plc decision to sell majority stake to Vedanta Resources. &amp;quot;It is really unfortunate that in spite of repeated persuasion, the core issue has not yet been clarified as to why ONGC having 30% participating interest in these fields, has not claimed its first right of acquisition,&amp;quot; he wrote. ONGC did not find exercising the prremptive rights as the acqusition cost offered by Vedanta to Cairn for the proposed transaction is much above the ONGC evaluated value. He, however, countered this saying ONGC's overseas arm ONGC Videsh Ltd has acquired assets abroad with much lower reserves and the rate of production then the Rajasthan fields. He pointed out to OVL's 2009 acqusition of Russia-focused Imperial Energy Corp for USD 2.12 billion. Imperial was producing 9,067 barrels per day in 2009 and 14,724 bpd till August 2010, he said. &amp;quot;I had therefore urged upon you repeatedly through my letters that valuation should be done in consultation with CAG, in national interest for rightful assertion of ONGC's right on these fields,&amp;quot; Sen wrote to Prime Minister.  He decried the &amp;quot;lack of response and concern&amp;quot; to the issues on the USD 9.6 billion Cairn-Vedanta deal he had raised several times. &amp;quot;I understand that Prime Minister's Office is not in favour of ONGC's investment in these assets on the plea of resource crunch. I am afraid, ONGC's present reserve and surplus of Rs 1.11 lakh crore and a profit of Rs 18,000 crore as on March 31, 2011 without any debt burden, does not give any scope of such apprehension,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I therefore urge upon you to please respond to the core issues raised in my letter with the seriousness they deserve and put them in the agenda of the Group of Minister (vetting the Cairn-Vedanta dea) to be taken on record and CAG be consulted before taking any final decision on this deal,&amp;quot; he added.","Business, Cairn India, ONGC, petroleum, Rajasthan, Vedanta","Business, Cairn India, ONGC, petroleum, Rajasthan, Vedanta",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cairn-should-exercise-preemption-rightsstake-sale_554975.html

The SMEs claim that they are receiving only 15,000 standard cubic meters per day (SCMD) of gas from ONGC, as against the agreed 1,00,000 SCMD. The KG Basin GAIL Isolated Wells Consumers Association (KGBGICA) -- an association of gas based industries operating in various isolated gas fields in the KG basin -- said that for the past one month, ONGC had drastically cut down gas supply from its Lingala-Kaikalur gas field in the KG basin to nine customers of GAIL, thereby disrupting the manufacturing processes and leading to heavy losses. The association said ONGC had been supplying to one of its other customers as per the allocated quantity of 75,000 SCMD. KGBGICA, which signed an agreement with ONGC for gas supply in 2003, later signed another agreement with GAIL after it became gas carrier for the region. The KGBGICA approached the petroleum ministry recently, protesting the alleged discrimination by ONGC against the GAIL consumers. &amp;quot;As many as 10,000 people get direct or indirect employment from these SMEs. But future seems bleak as there is no assurance from ONGC,&amp;quot; one of the KGBGICA members told PTI. Alternatives like Propane are six times costlier, sources said. When contacted, an ONGC official said the shortage was due to the depletion of gas in the wells, but did not say when the supply would reach the normal levels. &amp;quot;Kaikalur - Lingala Assets are small and marginal fields. Also these fields are operating for more than a decade. Since reserve is small, we observed a fast natural depletion in these fields.

2011-05-29T09:23:50+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,Govt panel may recommend royalty sharing in Cairn deal,"A government panel will recommend that the operators of Cairn Energy's key Indian oil field must share the royalty burden in proportion to their stake in the project, a government source said, which could derail Vedanta Resources' USD 9.6 billion deal for Cairn's India unit.","A government panel will recommend that the operators of Cairn Energy's key Indian oil field must share the royalty burden in proportion to their stake in the project, a government source said, which could derail Vedanta Resources' USD 9.6 billion deal for Cairn's India unit. Cairn Energy agreed in August to sell a majority stake in its Cairn India unit to London-listed Vedanta, but the deal has been delayed due to a dispute over royalty payments with Cairn India's partner in the Rajasthan project, state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp. &amp;quot;There was a unanimous recommendation that Cairn-Vedanta be given conditional approval and ONGC's interest should be protected, which means the companies would pay cess and royalty in proportion to their participating interest,&amp;quot; the source present at a Friday panel meeting told Reuters. ONGC, which has a 30% stake in the Cairn-operated Rajasthan fields, pays 100% of the royalty. Sharing the royalty burden and treating it as a cost for developing the field would effectively reduce the Cairn stake's profitability. Oil Minister S. Jaipal Reddy on Friday said the panel's recommendation would be sent to the cabinet in two weeks, further delaying a deal widely seen as a litmus test for foreign investment in India. Reddy did not say what the recommendation would be, but Reuters reported late on Friday that it would be conditional approval of the deal. Any change in the royalty structure would affect valuations and could jeopardise the deal, analysts have said. India's oil ministry has been pushing to share the royalty burden between ONGC and Cairn India, a move opposed by both UK-based Cairn and Vedanta. &amp;quot;How can ONGC pay 100% royalty and get 30% profit,&amp;quot; the source told Reuters on Saturday, adding that at an output rate of 175,000 barrels per day and an average price of USD 75 per barrel, ONGC's royalty burden could rise to Rs 180 billion (USD 4 billion) over 10 years. &amp;quot;Whatever profit ONGC would have got for its 30% stake would have been wiped out by this burden,&amp;quot; said the source, who declined to be identified because the panel's decision has not been made public. Cairn and Vedanta must agree to the government's conditions for the deal to be cleared by New Delhi, the source added. Cairn India currently pays 70% of cess liability under protest and has filed an arbitration case. The panel also recommended that Cairn should withdraw this arbitration as a condition of the deal winning approval, the source said. Earlier this month, Cairn extended the deadline for finalising the sale of a majority stake in its India unit for a second time, but did not set a new date. _PAGEBREAK_  VEDANTA MOVES AHEAD Despite the delays, Vedanta has gone ahead with an open offer to Cairn India's minority shareholders, in which it acquired 8.1% of equity. It also snapped up another 10.4% from Malaysia's Petronas last month as part of a wider effort to gain greater exposure to India's oil reserves and surging demand in the country.  Vedanta this week raised USD 1.65 billion by issuing bonds. If the deal with Cairn goes through, Vedanta will join BHP Billiton as the only major miners with significant oil interests. The deal would enable Cairn Energy to focus on exploration in Greenland, where it hopes to open up a new oil province with huge potential reserves, while also allowing it to return substantial amounts of cash to shareholders. Cairn India has the potential to almost double current production to about 240,000 barrels of oil per day, Vedanta has said. That accounts for around a quarter of India's output and allows it to benefit from rising demand spurred by industrialisation and economic growth.

Meanwhile, ahead of the GoM meet, London-listed mining group Vedanta Resources said it has raised USD 1.65 billion (Rs 7,425 crore) through private placement of bonds to part-finance its USD 9.4 billion acquisition of Cairn India.

Cairn-Vedanta deal referred to CCEA, decision in two weeks The recommendation of the Group of Ministers headed by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee will go to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) in two weeks time, Oil Minister S Jaipal Reddy told reporters after the 75-minute long meeting. Initial indications available suggest the GoM may have ignored the tougher option of asking Cairn or its successor to consent to paying cess on the all important Rajasthan block as well as agreeing to cost-recovery of Rs 18,000 crore in royalty that ONGC pays in the fields, as a pre-condition for the nod. &amp;quot;It (GoM) has looked at various aspects of the (USD 9.6 billion) deal. It has taken a view on the matter. This view will be presented to the CCEA. GoM is not going to meet again,&amp;quot; Reddy said. Refusing to divulge what the GoM recommendation will be, the minister however stated that his ministry's previous stand of supporting ONGC's demand for royalty being made cost recoverable from revenues of Rajasthan block &amp;quot;may not be GoM's recommendation&amp;quot;. Oil Ministry had till January supported the view that consent to Cairn-Vedanta deal should be pre-conditioned to agreement on demand made by ONGC in July 2010, a month before the USD 9.6 billion deal was announced. However, after Reddy took over in late January, the ministry diluted the stand and suggested an alternative that consent may be given without any condition and the government &amp;quot;shall take appropriate decision to enforce cost recovery of royalty&amp;quot;. The GoM appears to have gone with the second option, which was strongly supported by finance ministry.&amp;amp;nbsp;In both the cases, Cairn will have to seek consent of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp's (ONGC), which holds stake in 8 out of the 10 properties held by Cairn India in the country. Also, Vedanta will need a security clearance from the Ministry of Home Affairs.&amp;amp;nbsp;Cairn has refused to accept the requirement of partner consent even though five oil blocks it won under New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) explicitly provides for obtaining no objection from partners in case of change of ownership.

Solicitor General Gopal Subramaniam had in March opined that the government should not give unconditional nod to the deal but in April 6 slightly diluted it but reaffirmed the cost recoverability of royalty. He however refrained from saying if this along with Cairn being made to pay cess should be made a pre-condition for approval. ONGC owns a 30% stake in Cairn India's mainstay Rajasthan block, but is liable to pay 20% of crude oil price as royalty on the entire output from the field. Thisliability has made the project economically unviable for ONGC. Cairn is also contesting its liability to pay a Rs 2,500 per tonne cess on its 70% share.&amp;amp;nbsp;But unlike royalty, it is treating cess as a cost-recoverable item. All cost-recoverable items like capital and operating expenditure are first deducted from revenues earned from the sale of oil before profits are shared between stakeholders, including the government. Cairn Energy, which wants to sell at least a 40% stake in its Indian unit to Vedanta, and the London-listed mining group are opposed to making royalty cost-recoverable as it will lower the profitability of Cairn India.","Business, Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), Cairn Energy, Group of Ministers, Oil Minister S Jaipal Reddy, ONGC, Pranab Mukherjee, Vedanta Resources","Business, Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), Cairn Energy, Group of Ministers, Oil Minister S Jaipal Reddy, ONGC, Pranab Mukherjee, Vedanta Resources",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/gom-okays-selling-majority-stakecairn-india-to-vedanta_547414.html

Hardy, an India-focused explorer which recently sold its Nigerian assets, expects its profit this year to remain flat as the company will not bring any new wells on stream for production, Finance Director Dinesh Dattani told Reuters. It posted a calendar 2010 pretax profit of USD 2.2 million. Hardy expects production to increase to about 7,000 barrels of oil per day in 2012, after it drills more wells at the PY3 licence. Current production from the licence, where it has an 18% interest, averages about 3,300 bopd. &amp;quot;We have quadrupled reserves (here) since 1999. Now we're at a stage of further development,&amp;quot; Chief Executive Yogeshwar Sharma told Reuters. Hardy shares the PY3 licence with Indian state-run explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp, Hindustan Oil Exploration and industrial conglomerate Tata Group. The company, which had capital expenditure of more than USD 6 million last year, sees that increasing to USD 7-8 million this year as it drills two wells at the D9 block in the Bay of Bengal.  Not in talk for sale Hardy dismissed recent speculation it was an attractive bid target, saying it was not in talks with any company regarding a potential sale. &amp;quot;I'm flattered people were speculating we may be takeover target, but the board has no plans. We're not in discussions with anybody,&amp;quot; Sharma said. In March, analysts speculated Hardy Oil could become a potential target after BP tied up with India's Reliance Industries to explore deepwater oil and gas in a USD 7.2 billion deal. BP had bought a 30% stake in 23 oil and gas blocks, including licences D3 and D9, where Hardy holds a 10% interest in each. Shares in Hardy, valued at around 150 million pounds (USD 243 million), have risen by about a third since the BP-Reliance deal was announced in February.

Traditionally, upstream companies made up roughly one-third (33%) of the revenues lost on fuel sales through discounts on crude oil and products they sold to Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum. But the oil ministry yesterday issued orders raising the upstream contribution to 38.5%, they said, adding that ONGC has been ordered to chip in Rs 24,892.43 crore, while OIL will provide Rs 3,293 crore and GAIL Rs 2,111.24 crore.

Sources said the share of the upstream firms was increased as the Finance Ministry provided only Rs 20,001 crore in the second installment of the cash subsidy as against the demand of Rs 26,000 crore. While petrol prices were freed from the government control in June, state oil firms continue to sell diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene at government-ruled prices, which are substantially lower than the cost of production. IOC, BPCL and HPCL currently lose Rs 16.49 per litre on diesel, Rs 29.69 per litre on kerosene and Rs 329.73 per 14.2-kg LPG cylinder. In the 2010-11 fiscal, the three firms lost Rs 78,202 crore, but the government provided only Rs 40,912 crore in compensation. The oil marketing firms lost Rs 2,227 crore on selling petrol below imported cost during April and Junebefore its price was freed from government control.

Cairn and Vedanta have set May 20 as the deadline for closing the USD 9.6 billion transaction. Industry sources said Cairn is likely to seek another extension of the deadline in advance of its annual general meeting on May 19. It is not clear if the GoM would take more than one meeting to vet the proposal, after which it has to go back to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) -- the final approval authority in this case. Cairn, which had previously set April 15 as the deadline for concluding the sale, had raised a hue and cry over the government's procrastinated approach to vetting the deal, saying the timelines were sacrosanct and could not beextended. But a day after the CCEA on April 6 referred the deal for vetting to the GoM, the deadline was extended to May 20. The GoM, which, besides Mukherjee, compromises Oil Minister S Jaipal Reddy, Law Minister M Veerapa Moily, Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia and Telecom Minister Kapil Sibal, is split right in the middle on the issue of giving approval to the deal. The Law Ministry and Planning Commission have backed Reddy's first option of giving clearance to Vedanta only if it agrees to ONGC being allowed to recover the Rs 18,000 crore in royalty that the state-owned firm is liable to pay on behalf of Cairn India in the all-important Rajasthan oilfields. The Finance Ministry is in favour of Reddy's second option of the government giving consent without any precondition and taking appropriate decisions to protect ONGC's interests. The GoM to vet the Cairn-Vedanta deal was originally to have its first meeting on May 2. The ministerial panel was to deliberate on whether Vedanta, with no experience in oil and gas sector, should be given unconditional approval for buying a company that owns the nation's largest onland oil fields or given clearance after attaching reasonable conditions. The official said Reddy had listed two options. The first was giving approval subject to state-owned ONGC being allowed to recover the Rs 18,000 crore it is liable to pay in royalty on behalf of Cairn India. Alternatively, he suggested that the government gives its consent to the deal without any precondition and take an &amp;quot;appropriate decision&amp;quot; to enforce ONGC's right.

The Supreme Court set aside the orders of the High Court which said that it has jurisdiction to hear the petition of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to conduct the arbitration in Kuala Lumpur and not in London, as asked by the consortium. A bench of justices R V Raveendran and G S Singhvi held that as per the agreement between the government and the consortium, the arbitration should be governed by the English law only. &amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;We hold that the Delhi High Court did not have jurisdiction to entertain the petition filed by the government ...,&amp;quot; the bench said. The apex court further held that the High Court had no power to entertain the plea filed by the government seeking arbitration in Malaysia and governed by the Indian laws. &amp;quot;The parties had agreed that the arbitration agreement contained in Article 34 shall be governed by laws of England,&amp;quot; said the bench. The government had awarded Andhra Pradesh offshore oil field to a consortium of Videocon, Cairns, Ravva Oil and ONGC in 1994. However, later some dispute arose over the revenue sharing, profit correctness of certain cost recoveries and the matter was referred to arbitration in Malaysia.&amp;amp;nbsp; In March 2005, a tribunal passed an interim award in favour of the consortium and the government challenged it before the High Court of Malaysia two months after that. This was opposed by the Videocon and other contending that the award could not be challenged in the High Court of Malaysia as the agreement was governed by the English laws.  The government had also requested the Malaysian High court to conduct the remaining arbitral proceedings at Kuala Lumpur, but the request was rejected in April 2006. After that the government approached the Delhi High Court for stay of the arbitral proceedings.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; This was again opposed by the consortium. However, the high court overruled their objections and held that it has jurisdiction to entertain the petition. It was challenged by Videocon before the apex court.

ONGC had in July 2010, more than a month before Edinburgh-based Cairn Energy announced sale of majority stake in its Indian unit to Vedanta, demanded that Rs 18,000 crore in royalty it will pay over the life of Rajasthan oilfields should be cost recovered from revenues.","Business, Cairn India, Law Ministry, ONGC, Vedanta","Business, Cairn India, Law Ministry, ONGC, Vedanta",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cairn-vendanta-deal-moily-endorses-sgis-view-_533693.html

2011-03-28T20:12:00+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,"Global majors shun India oil, gas block auction","India failed to woo global players in its latest oil and gas exploration licensing round due to its dim track record of commercial discoveries and sluggish bureaucracy, while most of the 33 blocks went to domestic players.","India failed to woo global players in its latest oil and gas exploration licensing round due to its dim track record of commercial discoveries and sluggish bureaucracy, while most of the 33 blocks went to domestic players. Asia's third-largest economy needs private capital for exploration and is encouraging local firms to buy stakes in foreign oil and gas projects to meet its surging energy needs. India imports over 70% of the crude it uses and is keen to tap quickly domestic reservoirs. Global oil firms are more inclined to invest in countries with higher prospects for finds, but India's position has also suffered because of bureaucratic sloth. &amp;quot;Prospectivity is the key issue ... But India can be a difficult country to do business in. There's the issue of bureaucracy,&amp;quot; said Sara Pourghorbani, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie for India. &amp;quot;Bureaucracy actually seems to be quite a major issue for India. The pace of decision-making is quite slow,&amp;quot; Pourghorbani added. Monday's auction largely drew interest from international companies that already operate in India such as BG, BHP Billiton and Cairn Energy. Oil Minister S. Jaipal Reddy called the response to the auction &amp;quot;more than satisfactory&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;very encouraging&amp;quot;. BP, which has just bought a 30% stake in 23 Indian blocks owned by Reliance, did not put in a bid. BG, with BHP Billiton, applied for and won only one block.  Tightening scrutiny India is competing with big oil-producing countries worldwide for exploration interest that could help it achieve energy self-sufficiency. The situation has been exacerbated by a regulatory backlash as the government tightens scrutiny of projects to contain the political fallout of massive corruption cases. Oil Secretary S Sundareshan told reporters that contracts for the new blocks could be signed within three months. A total of 34 blocks were initially on offer under the ninth licensing round, but one shallow water block received no bids. The winning bids have to be endorsed by India's cabinet. Of the 33 blocks, eight are deepwater, six shallow water and 19 onshore blocks. Official data showed that foreign firms, including Deep Energy of the United States, had won five blocks, while the rest were bagged by Indian companies, repeating a pattern seen in previous rounds. A consortium led by state-run explorer ONGC had provisionally won 10 blocks, and Reliance Industries had won two blocks. The blocks are being offered under India's New Exploration and Licensing Policy (NELP), which was launched in 1999 offering more attractive terms to boost higher investment in the oil and gas sector of Asia's third-largest oil consumer. India is currently producing around 720,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil, mostly from fields awarded decades ago -- less than a quarter of its 3.18 million bpd demand. Proven oil reserves amounted to 5.8 billion barrels in 2009 -- enough only to satisfy its oil needs for about five years, according to the BP Statistical Review. Indian oil firms are seeking foreign expertise to tap into the country's largely unexplored deep offshore water, which will require billions of dollars of investment. The previous eight rounds have been dominated by Indian firms, with ONGC and Oil India bagging more that half of total 234 blocks awarded.

2011-02-14T08:29:18+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,ONGC share sale seen set to go ahead,"State-run Oil &amp;amp; Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) will file for a near USD 3 billion share sale by the end of February and expects to launch the offer in mid-March, as planned, its finance chief said on Sunday.","State-run Oil &amp;amp;amp; Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) will file for a near USD 3 billion share sale by the end of February and expects to launch the offer in mid-March, as planned, its finance chief said on Sunday. DK Sarraf, ONGC's director of finance, told Reuters he expects the sale to raise Rs 125-130 billion ( USD 2.7 billion- USD 2.8 billion), depending on the government's pricing. &amp;quot;We are expecting a good response from all quarters, including foreign and retail investors,&amp;quot; Sarraf said. The government, which owns 74.14% of ONGC, plans to sell 5% in the offer as part of wider plan to sell stakes in about 60 state-run firms over the next few years to cut its fiscal deficit and garner funds for the poor. But the main Indian share market index has declined 13.6% this year, as foreign funds pulled out a net USD 1.5 billion from equities. Last week the chairman of Indian Oil Corp, the country's biggest refiner and oil retailer, said its planned share sale would be delayed due to unfavourable market conditions and rising global crude prices. However, Sarraf said ONGC was sticking to its earlier plans of launching its share sale around mid-March. ONGC's Chairman AK Hazarika said on February 1 that the offer may open on March 15. ONGC has already started &amp;quot;pre-marketing&amp;quot; meetings with local funds and investors, Sarraf said, with overseas road shows for the sale planned for immediately after the regulatory filing. Uncertainty about India's oil subsidy regime clouds the outlook for ONGC, which is forced to sell crude at a discounted price to state-run refiners who in turn sell diesel, cooking gas and kerosene at prices set by the government. Also, ONGC owns a 30% stake in some of the assets of Cairn India, whose parent Cairn Energy has agreed to sell up to 51% of the Indian unit to London-listed miner Vedanta Resources. ONGC pays 100% of the royalties on those assets to the government, and now wants Vedanta to pay a share or account for royalty payments in the overall exploration costs, delaying the deal. The oil ministry has said it will protect ONGC's interests. &amp;quot;These questions are being asked, but all these are already known in the market and hence not likely to have any bearing (on the share sale),&amp;quot; Sarraf said, when asked if investors were concerned about the subsidy regime and the Cairn royalty issue. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citi, HSBC, JM Financial, Morgan Stanley and Nomura have been apponted to manage the share sale. Shares in ONGC, the country's second-most valuable listed firm with a market capitalisation of over USD 52 billion, closed 1.4% higher on Friday. The shares are down about 14% this year in line with the broader market. &amp;amp;nbsp;","Business, Oil & Natural Gas Corp, Share sale","Business, Oil &amp;amp;amp; Natural Gas Corp, Share sale",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-share-sale-seen-set-to-go-ahead_522479.html

But with Sharma retiring today, he is volunteering his personal services to ensure the Cairn-Vedanta deal goes through. Sharma's displeasure with the USD 9.6 billion Cairn-Vedanta deal is publicly documented. Infact last week, an ONGC board meeting was called to finalise ONGC's official stance on the deal.  The board noted ONGC has pre-emptive rights and even though its not interested in a counter offer, its approval is necessary. Five months after the announcement of the proposed transaction, Sharma is now calling for a quick resolution. The main bone of contention is the royalty issue. ONGC currently pays all 100% of the royalty for the prolific Barmer fields but wants this to be cut to 30%, which is what its stake in the Rajasthan field is. This pre-condition has led to recent attempts to resolve this issue failing. Last week the Barmer project management committee met, where Cairn disagreed with ONGC's view that royalty is cost recoverable. Cairn also went on to say that such a move would bring down the government share of profit oil. Cairn is also believed to have said that while it has no objections to the government giving its views on the royalty row, the centre cannot resolve the issue. Cairn is very clear in its stance: ONGC is free to invoke arbitration as provided for by the dispute resolution mechanism.

Cairn Energy agreed in August to sell a stake of 40%-51% in Cairn India to Vedanta but the deal has been delayed on rumblings from the Indian government and from ONGC and dented India's attractiveness for foreign investors. Sharma said the parties ought to sit down and thrash out a solution on payment of royalties on the crude. ONGC has a 30% stake in the Rajasthan block but pays royalty on the entire production. ONGC has, in the past, said the royalty payment should be shared proportionately by the two partners. &amp;quot;We want a quick resolution through bilateral discussions. The parties need to sit together and find out a viable solution.&amp;quot;","Business, Cairn Energy, Oil and Natural Gas Corp","Business, Cairn Energy, Oil and Natural Gas Corp",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-not-to-exercise-rightscairn-vedanta-deal_517086.html

The state-run explorer had shut oil and gas wells and other facilities attached to the Mumbai-Uran Trunk (MUT) pipeline that pumps crude from the Mumbai High field, India's biggest oil producing block, as a safety measure and diverted supplies to the ICP-Heera Uran Trunk pipeline. The leakage led to a loss of some 25,000 barrels which caused an oil spill about 80 kilometres off the Mumbai coast, the company said. &amp;quot;It has been estimated that the oil spill will be dispersed within 48 hours,&amp;quot; ONGC, India's largest oil producer, said in a statement, adding surveillance and monitoring of operations will continue jointly by the firm and the Coast Guard. Oil Secretary S. Sundareshan earlier said the pipeline flow had been stopped and described the loss from the leak as &amp;quot;fairly small,&amp;quot; limited to just the oil in the pipeline at the time. A loss of 25,000 barrels is just over 10 percent of daily pumping capacity of the pipeline or about 6.5 percent of the Mumbai High block.

2011-10-10T15:51:05+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,ONGC says net profit to dip below Rs 10000cr this fiscal,"State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has said its net profit will drop by over 47% to below Rs 10,000 crore this fiscal if the government forces it to shell out a higher fuel subsidy.","State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has said its net profit will drop by over 47% to below Rs 10,000 crore this fiscal if the government forces it to shell out a higher fuel subsidy. Upstream oil firms, led by ONGC, traditionally bear one-third of the actual revenue that retailers lose on selling diesel, LPG and kerosene at government-controlled prices. But this year, the share of upstream companies would not be based on the actual under-recoveries, or revenue losses, of retailers. Rather, they would be based on the projected notional under-recoveries that existed before the June fuel price increase and duty cuts. At a USD 110 per barrel crude oil price, the revenue loss before the June price hike was estimated at Rs 171,140 crore, while at today's prices, it stands at around Rs 121,140 crore. ONGC, in a letter to the Oil Ministry, said the one-third share of upstream companies as per the June estimates works out to Rs 57,041 crore, of which ONGC's share would be Rs 47,361 crore. But if current estimates, are taken the upstream share would be Rs 40,380 crore (Rs 33,528 crore of ONGC). The company gives discounts on the crude oil it sells to Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum to part- meet the revenue loss retailers incur on subsidised fuel sales. &amp;quot;In such a scenario (where upstream firms are asked to pay one-third of the projected under-recoveries in June), the price realisation of ONGC would be USD 41.27 per barrel,&amp;quot; it wrote. ONGC said it expects to register a net profit of Rs 15,000 crore in the 2011-12 fiscal, based on a net crude oil price realisation of USD 55 per barrel. &amp;quot;In case realisation is of the order of USD 40 per barrel, the profit-after-tax would be below Rs 10,000 crore.&amp;quot; It had in 2010-11 reported a net profit of Rs 18,924 crore. ONGC said a lower profit would hurt its Rs 30,000 crore planned capital expenditure and also impact plans to provide another Rs 7,500 crore in financial support to its overseas subsidiary in 2011-12. Stating that it normally caters to investment plans from its internal resources, it said even at a net profit of Rs 15,000 crore, the company faced a shortfall of about Rs 12,500 crore in meeting its planned expenditure and assistance to ONGC Videsh Ltd in FY'12. &amp;quot;However, in case ONGC's net realisation for 2011-12 works out to USD 40 per barrel, ONGC's profit-after-tax is expected to fall down below Rs 10,000 crore and the deficit would increase to Rs 17,500 crore,&amp;quot; it wrote. ONGC had in 2010-11 paid Rs 24,892 crore out of the total upstream fuel subsidy share of Rs 30,297 crore. In the first quarter of current fiscal, it paid Rs 12,046 crore to compensate for fuel subsidies. ONGC has not been able to get any significant price advantage from the increase in crude oil prices due to sharing of under-recoveries, as the cost of procurement of oilfield services and materials have increased significantly, the company wrote. &amp;quot;(Out of) every rupee increase in ONGC's revenue from crude oil, about two-third amount is contributed to the central/state government by way of incremental royalty, VAT/central sales tax, corporate tax, dividend and dividend distribution tax,&amp;quot; it said. The company said if its share of under-recoveries was reduced, this would result in a corresponding increase in the revenues it contributes to the government exchequer. ONGC said the upstream share of under-recoveries should be 33.33% if crude oil prices remained below USD 70 per barrel. However, it should reduce to 30% if crude rises to USD 75 per barrel and progressively reduce with every dollar increase in oil price. The upstream subsidy share should be limited to 25% at times when oil prices cross USD 100 per barrel, it said. &amp;quot;The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas is requested to notify a fair and transparent mechanism for sharing of under-recoveries,&amp;quot; the company wrote.","Business, kerosene, LPG, Oil and Natural Gas Corp, oil ministry","Business, kerosene, LPG, Oil and Natural Gas Corp, oil ministry",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-says-net-profit-to-dip-below-rs-10000cr-this-fiscal_596321.html

We will revisit our strategy of exploration,&amp;quot; Sudhir Vasudeva said in his first media event after taking charge on Monday. Vasudeva said his aim is to raise the firm's oil output to 28 million tonnes or 560,000 barrels per day (bpd) by March 2014 and gas production by 58% to 36.5 billion cubic metres by March 2017. India, the world's fourth-biggest oil importer, buys in nearly 80% of its oil needs as expanding refining capacity has outpaced growth in local oil output. ONGC's local oil output has been almost stagnant in the last five years. ONGC produces about 63% of India's oil output, which was 767,900 barrels per day in August, according to government data. The bulk of ONGC's oil and gas output comes from old fields that were witnessing an annual decline of 7-8% until a few years ago, when it began implementing techniques to improve oil and gas recovery. Total investment in lifting output from these fields would touch 260 billion rupees (USD 5.3 billion) by 2013-14, he said. ONGC's oil output has declined about 6% in the four years to March 2011, while gas output has risen about 3% to 23.10 billion cubic metres during the period, a company statement said. Vasudeva said ONGC is open to partnership with global firms to raise its output -- something private Indian company Reliance Industries did earlier this year. Reliance agreed to sell a 30% stake in 23 oil and gas blocks to BP in a deal worth USD 7.2 billion, hoping to get the multinational company's expertise to help lift gas output from its D6 block off the east coast. &amp;quot;We are open to all sorts of partnerships -- whether it is strategic or for technology,&amp;quot; Vasudeva said. In June, Vasudeva's predecessor A.K. Hazarika said Italy's Eni and BG Group were interested in partnering ONGC for developing its gas-rich east coast block. The Indian government wants ONGC to secure energy supplies overseas to fuel the country's fast-growing economy. Vasudeva said ONGC would try to secure 400,000 bpd of oil from abroad earlier than its target of 2020. ONGC currently gets 190,000 bpd oil from its overseas assets.

The finance ministry wants upstream oil and gas producers like ONGC to meet one-third of the Rs 1,70,140 crore revenue loss that was projected prior to the June fuel price hike and duty cuts instead of about Rs 1,14,084 crore actual loss the retailers may suffer on selling fuel below cost this fiscal. Upstream oil firms bear one-third of the revenue that retailers lose on selling diesel, domestic LPG and Kerosene at government-controlled rates. A similar amount is contributed by the government by way of cash subsidy while the rest is either absorbed by the retailers or passed on to consumers. Sources privy to the development said the finance ministry wants upstream share to be fixed at Rs 56,707 crore or one-third of the revenue loss estimated before the June price hike and cut in customs and excise duty. Of this, ONGC's share would be Rs Rs 47,640 crore and the rest would be split between Oil India and GAIL India. It argues that the government has taken a hit of Rs 49,000 crore by way of cut in customs duty on crude oil and petroleum products, and reduction in excise duty on diesel. Post duty rejig and a Rs 3 per litre hike in diesel, Rs 2 per litre increase in kerosene and Rs 50 per cylinder hike in domestic LPG rates, the revenue loss now is estimated at Rs 114,084 crore. One-third of this comes to Rs 38,024 crore, of which ONGC would have borne Rs 31,943.5 crore.  ONGC in 2010-11 provided Rs 24,892 crore fuel subsidy. Company officials said they haven't got anything in writing from the government on subsidy sharing but confirmed there were talks of raising ONGC's outgo. Some industry observers are linking the postponement of the follow-on public offer (FPO) of ONGC to hammering its scrip may see because of increased subsidy outgo. But ONGC officials maintained that the decision to defer the share sale was taken by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and the Disinvestment Secretary Mohammed Haleem Khan who felt the FPO may not garner the right value keeping in mind the market volatility. The public issue through which the government is to sell 5% of its shareholding to garner between Rs 11,000 crore to Rs 12,000 crore, was to open on September 20 and close on September 23. Sources said the FPO can happen by mid-October on the basis of the red herring prospectus filed by the company with the Registrar of Companies earlier this month. Beyond that, it would be required to update the RHP with second quarter earning numbers and refile it.","Business, ONGC","Business, ONGC",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/finmin-wants-ongc-others-to-give-rs-56700-cr-fuel-subsidy_587874.html

Oil &amp;amp;amp; gas exploration companies like ONGC and Oil India too gained 2.7 percent and 1.8 percent amid large volumes, respectively as their subsidy sharing burden may fall if the government considers diesel price hike. Diesel prices may be hiked by Rs 10 per litre over a 10-month period and kerosene rates increased by same quantum over the next two years if a proposal being mulled in the Oil Ministry is accepted. The price hike is being considered as the government scrambles to find ways to meet an unprecedented Rs 160,000 crore deficit expected this fiscal on selling diesel, cooking gas (LPG) and kerosene below their production cost. Price of diesel, which currently costs Rs 47.15 per litre in Delhi, was last revised on September 14 when it was hiked by a steep Rs 5.63 per litre. Kerosene rates have not changed since June last year and it currently costs Rs 14.79 per litre in Delhi. &amp;quot;We are left with no choices... there is a need to raise prices. The government is contemplating raising diesel prices by Re one per litre each month for next 10 months to bring retail rates at par with their cost,&amp;quot; an Oil Ministry source said. State-owned oil companies currently sell diesel at a loss of Rs 9.28 per litre and the hikes over the next 10 months will eliminate all of the losses and absolve the government from providing any subsidy on the nation's most consumed fuel.  While government is likely to raise soon the number of subsidised cooking gas (LPG) from 6 to 9 cylinder of 14.2-kg per household annually, the ministry wanted to have just two rates for the fuel -- a subsidised price and a market rate, instead of four rates presently, he said.

Qatar Petroleum, the Persian Gulf country's state-run energy firm, has majority stakes in RasGas and QatarGas that along with other liquefied natural gas (LNG) suppliers in the world compete to sell fuel to India. If Qatar Petroleum (QP) picks up 5.2 per cent stake as well as board position in Petronet, it will give the company an undue advantage over other suppliers as it will be privy to price and other negotiations, sources in Petronet's promoter firms said. This will possibly be the first instance of a LNG supplier picking up stake in an importing firm. Sources said Asian Development Bank (ADB) wants to sell its 5.2 per cent stake in Petronet since last year. Petronet, which is registered as a private company even though public sector oil firms hold 50 per cent stake and Oil Secretary is its Chairman, has approached QP's 100 per cent subsidiary Qatar Petroleum International offering ADB's stake. The PSUs -- Indian Oil, Oil &amp;amp;amp; Natural Gas Corp, Bharat Petroleum and GAIL India -- had previously evinced interest in buying the ADB stake but the Oil Ministry blocked the move as it would have turned Petronet into a public sector company. It was then offered to Qatar Petroleum International. But the stake being picked up by QP will lead to a potential conflict situation, sources said. RasGas, in which QP holds 70 per cent stake, supplies 7.5 million tonnes of LNG on a long-term contract to Petronet. It remains a potential supplier for the new terminals that Petronet is building at Kochi and east coast and a board position may give it an undue advantage, they said. In fact, RasGas had in the contract to supply 7.5 million tonnes LNG promised to give 5 per cent stake to Petronet or its nominee in the liquefication plant in Qatar. This clause was the same that RasGas had promised Korea's KoGas in a LNG supply deal. Article 30.7 of the agreement with Petronet promised the stake at &amp;quot;no premium&amp;quot; but RasGas reneged on its commitment and demanded a premium from ONGC, which was nominated to take the stake. The talks broke down on the premium asked, sources said. Sources said Qatar Petroleum getting stake is like vendor picking up a board position in a company that gives out contracts. One seller on board will be disadvantage to other sellers, they added. .","Business, Petronet LNG, Qatar Petroleum, stake sale","Business, Petronet LNG, Qatar Petroleum, stake sale",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/qatar-petroleum-keen-to-buy-stakepetronet-lng-_799448.html

HPCL last week asked the ministry to give firm allocation of Rajasthan crude oil for at least 10 years for it to begin work on the 9 million tonne a year refinery, sources with direct knowledge of the deliberations said. Also Read: Crude Oil prices may trade with positive bias: Nirmal Bang Cairn produces about 175,000 barrels a day or 8.75 million tonne a year of crude oil from its Mangala and other fields in the Rajasthan block. Going fowards, the firm is projecting an output of 300,000 bpd (15 million tonne). But the approved plateau is only 175,000 bpd and there is no certified data available to state that this level will last for the next 15 years (five years for refinery construction and 10 years allocation as requested by HPCL). Sources said an inland refinery is not feasible unless it has a definite source of crude oil for initial 10 years of operations. Without a crude source, it does not make any sense to build an inland unit and the company would rather look at a coastal option where crude oil can be imported from abroad. For an inland refinery, crude oil will have to be first imported at a port on the west coast, probably in Gujarat, and then transported to hinterland through an expensive pipeline. Crude oil produced at Rajasthan is transported through world's largest heated pipeline from Barmer to refiners like Reliance Industries and Essar Oil in Gujarat. Sources said if Rajasthan crude oil is allocated to the proposal refinery, this pipeline can be used for transporting imported crude oil from Gujarat coast in subsequent years. HPCL is to hold 51 per cent stake in the proposed refinery project while state-owned engineering consultancy firm EIL would take 5 per cent. Vedanta Resources, which last year acquired Cairn India for USD 8.67 billion, is interested in taking a small equity of 2-3 per cent in the project. Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd and Rajasthan government too are keen on a stake in the refinery. ONGC, which owns 30 per cent interest in the Barmer oilfields of Cairn India, had in 2005 committed to building the refinery in Rajasthan but later had a change of heart. Sources said after HPCL decided to take up the project, ONGC, which originally had the authorisation from the government for processing the Barmer crude at the proposed refinery, too evinced interest in taking 26 per cent stake. However, HPCL is not keen on giving anything more than 16.96 per cent to ONGC. This being equivalent to the stake that ONGC has allowed HPCL to hold in Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd.","Barmer, Business, Cairn India, Crude oil, Essar Oil, Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd., HPCL, Oil India Ltd, ONGC, Rajasthan, Reliance Industries","Barmer, Business, Cairn India, Crude oil, Essar Oil, Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd., HPCL, Oil India Ltd, ONGC, Rajasthan, Reliance Industries",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/barmer-refinery-unviable-without-all-crudecairn-hpcl_793272.html

In its biggest acquisition till date, ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of Oil &amp;amp;amp; Natural Gas Corp last month agreed to pay US energy giant ConocoPhillips about USD 5 billion for the 8.4 per cent stake in Kashagan, the biggest oilfield discovery in over four decades. Also Read: ONGC's acquiring stake in Kashagan oilfield will raise debt The deal is subject to the approval of governments of Kazakhstan and India and also to other partners in the Caspian Sea field waiving their right of first refusal. Industry sources said Italy's Eni, the operator of the first phase of the Kashagan oilfield that is due to start production in second quarter of 2013, has publicly stated that it will not pre-empt or block the sale. Eni, ExxonMobil of US, Royal Dutch Shell, France's Total and Kazakhstan's Kazmunaigas (KMG) hold 16.81 per cent stake each in the field, while Japan's Inpex the remaining 7.56 per cent. Sources said the partners have 60 days to decide on exercising their right of first refusal on ConocoPhillips' stake. Once all the other five companies in the project waive their pre-emption rights, the deal will go before Kazakhstan government, which contractually has 180 days to clear it. Sources said on the previous two occasions when companies sold out of Kashagan, the other partners pre-empted. Originally, Kashagan field had Eni, BG Group of UK, ExxonMobil, Shell, Total and Kazakh government with 14.28 per cent stake each. BP had 9.52 per cent and Norway's Statoil 4.76 per cent. Inpex of Japan and ConocoPhillips entered the consortium in 1998, purchasing Kazakhstan's 14.28 per cent share. In 2001, when Total agreed to buy BP and Statoil's stakes, all other partners exercised their pre-emption rights and the stake was equally split among them. Subsequently, the shareholding in the project was -- BG, Eni-Agip, ExxonMobil, Shell and Total (16.67 per cent each), ConocoPhillips and Inpex (8.33 per cent each). Then again in 2003, when BG agreed to sell its 16.67 per cent interest to Chinese state duo Sinopec and China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), the pre-emption rights were exercised. Kazakhstan purchased half (8.33 per cent) of BG's share while other consortium members shared the remaining. In 2008, a new contract was signed wherein KMG's share was doubled from 8.33 per cent to 16.66 per cent with other partners taking proportionate cuts. Under Kazakh law, KMG would have the first option to purchase Conoco's stake and in October the company had publicly expressed interest in Conoco's holding. After years of delay and at a total cost of more than USD 40 billion, Kashagan is due to begin production in second quarter of 2012, sources said. Kashagan holds 33 billion barrels of inplace oil reserves, of which about 10 billion are potentially recoverable. Of this, OVL's share will be 842 million barrels. The Kazakhstan government has approved first of the three phases and production is likely to start in second quarter of 2013. At approved peak from phase-1, OVL's share will be close to 1.6 million tonnes, sources said adding over 25-year period the company's share comes to an average of 1 million tonnes per annum. Kashagan, the biggest world oilfield discovery since 1968, may produce 370,000 barrels of oil per day at peak and in subsequent phases, the output may rise up to 450,000 bpd (22.5 million tonnes per annum). When Phase 2 and 3 are implemented, the OVL's share will be significantly higher, they added.","Business, China National Petroleum Corp, Kazakhstan, ONGC, ONGC Videsh Ltd","Business, China National Petroleum Corp, Kazakhstan, ONGC, ONGC Videsh Ltd",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-gets-project-operators-nod-for-kashagan-stake-buy_791686.html

2012-12-03T08:16:03+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,Indian oil firms focus on production to get foreign assets,"Faced with soaring demand, stagnant output at home and a need to diversify from Iranian crude imports lost to Western sanctions, Indian oil companies are hungry for deals like ONGC's Kashagan buy that promise supplies sooner rather than later.","Faced with soaring demand, stagnant output at home and a need to diversify from Iranian crude imports lost to Western sanctions, Indian oil companies are hungry for deals like ONGC's Kashagan buy that promise supplies sooner rather than later. State-run ONGC Videsh has agreed to pay about USD 5 billion for 8.4 percent of the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan, the world's largest oilfield discovery in four decades - which could boost its output by about 16 percent within a year. The deal adds to a stable of assets that span some of the trickiest territories in the world - Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Syria and Libya among them - accumulated as parent Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) struggled with domestic output. But it's a drop in the ocean for the world's fourth-biggest crude importer - it buys in 3.5 million barrels per day (bpd) - where the energy gap triggers constant power cuts. Asia's third-largest economy plans to hit 8 percent growth in 2014/15 and by 2030 that could lift it to be third-largest in the world and also the No. 3 energy consumer, according to BP. Oil supplies have become more urgent as Western sanctions over nuclear projects squeeze Iran, once India's second-biggest supplier. India's imports from Tehran slipped by nearly a fifth to 257,000 bpd in April-September. &amp;quot;Our priority is to look for discovered, developed and producing assets which give us production growth immediately,&amp;quot; T.K. Anantha Kumar, head of finance for Oil India , the country's other state-run explorer, told Reuters. While not all the oil bought overseas turns up in domestic refineries, it can give companies a stake in the global crude trade, enhancing their flexibility for supplies and potentially helping profits. ONGC Videsh said in its 2011/12 annual report that its tough production targets - 20 million tonnes of oil equivalent by 2017/18 and 60 million tonnes by 2029/30 - mean it &amp;quot;needs to concentrate on acquiring assets in (the) development and production phase initially&amp;quot; before looking at exploration acreage. Parent ONGC does not have a good track record in exploration and was slated this year by the state auditor for focusing too much on producing fields at home. &amp;quot;Definitely we are looking at a good mix of producing as well as exploration assets because we want to increase our contribution&amp;quot; to India's energy security, an ONGC Videsh official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. ACQUISITIVE ASIA Indian companies will face sharp competition for these assets, however, from Asian rivals Japan and China - also major clients of Iran and facing their own demand challenges, the former because of nuclear power plant closures. With all but two of Japan's reactors idled and the government set on reducing reliance on atomic power after the Fukushima disaster, Japan's energy explorers are on a quest for upstream assets overseas, often with strong state support. Should ONGC complete the purchase of the Kashagan stake - ConocoPhillips' existing partners in the project have a right of first refusal on it - it could be working alongside Japan's biggest energy explorer, Inpex Corp, which has a 7.56 percent share. Chinese state oil companies CNOOC Sinopec Group, the parent of Sinopec Corp and PetroChina have been among the world's most acquisitive oil firms in recent years. CNOOC has bid USD 15.1 billion for Canadian oil and gas producer Nexen , while Sinopec recently paid USD 1.5 billion for UK North Sea assets and &amp;amp;#36;2.5 billion for a one-fifth stake in a Nigerian offshore field. Asian companies may be willing to buy into countries where the political situation deters Western buyers - reflected in the spread of their portfolios. The Kashagan field has been plagued by disputes with the Kazakh government and cost overruns. &amp;quot;In some cases, the political context can inhibit international oil companies from investing in a country where Chinese and other Asian companies have jumped in,&amp;quot; said Siddik Bakir, Middle East and South Asia energy analyst at IHS World Markets Energy in London, in an email. Chinese companies, which have also suffered in Sudan and Syria, are interested in investing in Myanmar and have often leveraged government-to-government deals with developing or politically risky countries where international majors can't or don't bother to go. More recently, both Chinese and Indian companies have turned their attention to OECD countries such as Canada and the United States, while maintaining their interest in the rich prospects of Latin America and Africa. ONGC Videsh, for example, is focusing on Africa and Latin America, its managing director, DK Sarraf, said, after a policy shift last year away from politically risky regions. Oil India is focused on North America and Africa. BIG CHEQUES And while the search for fundamental energy supplies such as oil, natural gas and coal continues, new sources such as oil sands or shale deposits are taking centre stage. Chinese companies have struck multi-billion dollar deals for such assets in the United States, and an Indian consortium - including ONGC and Oil India - is in the running for oil sands properties in Canada. ONGC Videsh &amp;quot;will need to be prepared to face more international competition on a regional and global level, particularly from Chinese companies,&amp;quot; Bakir said. &amp;quot;Indian state-run companies don't have a good track record of competing and winning against Chinese companies in a bidding scenario, especially when you have to write a cheque for more than USD 5 billion,&amp;quot; said a resources banker with a European bank in Mumbai. &amp;quot;In those cases, Chinese companies will continue to have an upper hand.&amp;quot; ONGC Videsh reckons it needs USD 20 billion to buy the assets it needs up to 2030, while Oil India is looking to invest up to USD 1.82 billion for assets that could give it an extra 1.5-1.75 million tonnes a year of oil. But unlike Chinese companies which enjoy financial independence, India's state-owned energy companies have not been very successful in closing big overseas acquisitions, often because of delays in securing government approvals at home. They may be sitting on huge piles of cash, but New Delhi is in no mood to throw money around at the moment with a fiscal deficit big enough to threaten an expensive credit downgrade.","Business, crude, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC)","Business, crude, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC)",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/indian-oil-firms-focusproduction-to-get-foreign-assets_789701.html

Also Read: OVL's &amp;amp;#36;5-bn Kashagan stake buy pushes ONGC up 1.4% Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has been struggling to generate positive free cash flows given its already high capital expenditure programme (about USD 7.5 billion in current year) and projected rise in its fuel subsidy outgo to Rs 60,000 crore from Rs 50,000 crore last year, it said. &amp;quot;For the 12 months ended March 31, ONGC generated free cash flow of USD 145 million and had USD 3.2 billion of debt and nearly USD 5 billion of cash. &amp;quot;We expect ONGC to increase its net borrowings by approximately USD 5 billion to fund this acquisition,&amp;quot; it said. ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of the state explorer, had earlier this week said it will pay about USD 5 billion from ConocoPhillips for the Kashagan stake. The deal, which is subject to relevant regulatory approvals, priority rights and consortium preemption rights, is to close in the first half of 2013. The acquisition would mark ONGC's entry into the oil-proven North Caspian Sea of Kazakhstan. According to the company, the acquisition would likely add an average annual production of about 7.3 million barrels for more than 25 years, with a peak of about 11.7 million barrels. ONGC produced nearly 450 million barrels of oil and gas for the year ended March 31, and the acquisition would add less than 2 per cent to its annual production. &amp;quot;The acquisition also bears significant strategic importance to India in terms of contributing to the country's energy security. India imports nearly 80 per cent of its crude annually, and this acquisition is a step toward reducing its reliance on imports,&amp;quot; Moody's said. The Kashagan Field, located in the shallow waters (about five to eight meters) of the Kazakh North Caspian Sea, is one of the world's largest development projects. &amp;quot;The acquisition exposes ONGC to the project's execution risk: there have been multiple delays and cost overruns over the past decade,&amp;quot; it said. Moody's said ONGC's expectation of the first production from the field next year &amp;quot;somewhat mitigates the execution risk.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Nonetheless, subsequent phases of the project could face similar delays or cost overruns,&amp;quot; it said. In addition to the USD 5 billion acquisition cost, ONGC will also need to make its share of investments in the subsequent phases of the project, with those costs based on future discoveries and sums that could be as high or higher than this USD 5 billion investment, it said. Moody's said the Kashagan acquisition is in line with ONGC's overall strategy. ONGC has recently formulated its 'Perspective Plan - 2030,' projecting OVL's oil and gas production at 440 million barrels by 2030, up from 146 million barrels in 2018 and 64 million barrels in fiscal 2012. The company plans to invest nearly USD 200 billion over the next 17 years to reach its goal. For ConocoPhillips, the sale is credit positive. Its 8.4 per cent stake will generate USD 5 billion of proceeds that moves it closer to its targeted USD 8-10 billion of asset sales by year-end 2013. &amp;quot;The proceeds are key to filling a cash flow gap and funding a large capital programme, while enhancing liquidity and helping maintain a solid leverage profile. &amp;quot;The Kashagan project has been a high-profile, but ultimately a high-cost venture for ConocoPhillips. It is a small portion of the company's current production and reserves, and the capital can be reinvested in higher-return investments,&amp;quot; it said.","Business, ConocoPhillips, Moody's, Oil and Natural Gas Corp, ONGC, Rating agency","Business, ConocoPhillips, Moody's, Oil and Natural Gas Corp, ONGC, Rating agency",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongcs-acquiring-stakekashagan-oilfield-will-raise-debt_788553.html

OVL and its partners had in January shut oil production from the Greater Nile Petroleum project after a dispute between South Sudan and Sudan over pipeline transit fees. Production can resume within a few weeks followingresolution of the dispute, sources said adding output may start as early as mid-December. South Sudan in September signed a long-awaited cooperation agreement, paving the way for resumption of oil exports. South Sudan has billions of barrels of oil, but the pipeline to export it runs through the north. The south shut down production in January after feud with north over terms. As per the agreement reached, oil producers like Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company, where ONGC Videsh Ltd has 25 per cent interest alongside Chinese and Malaysian firms, will pay USD 8.40 per barrel transportation charge and another USD 1.60 as processing fee, sources said. Further, a USD 1 per barrel transit fee is to be paid for allowing passage of oil. Sources said OVL is seeking exemption from payment of the transit fee on moving crude oil from its fields in South Sudan to ports in North for exports, saying fiscal stability prudence demands that its investment made before the African nation was split into two should be protected. GNPOC produced about 85,000 barrels per day of crude oil before the fields were shut. OVL's share in it was 25 percent. GNPOC concession in the Western Upper Line area include the large Unity and Heglig oil fields plus smaller fields at El Toor, El Noor, Toma South, Bamboo, Munga and Diffra.

Petrol prices were last revised on October 27 when they were raised by 29 paise to Rs 68.19 per litre in Delhi following government raising the commission paid to petrol pump dealers. &amp;quot;There has been some reduction in gasoline rates (against&amp;amp;nbsp; which the domestic price of petrol is benchmarked against) giving us some margins (on petrol). But they have moved up again in the last few days. &amp;quot;Also, rupee has appreciated against the US dollar ... we have to take a view (on prices) keeping all these factors in mind,&amp;quot; said R S Butola, Chairman of Indian Oil Corp, the nation's largest fuel retailer. The oil companies were making a margin of close to Rs 2 per litre, but considering the impact of rise in gasoline rate and appreciation in rupee, the net available margin may be just around Re 1 per litre. &amp;quot;We will review (prices) in next few days ... may be at the end of the week or early next week,&amp;quot; Butola said. The government had in June 2010 deregulated petrol prices giving oil companies freedom to fix rates in line with the cost. However, prices have seldom moved in line with cost and oil companies buckled under political pressure to keep rates checked to help the government manage inflation.

The bid from the group, which comprises producers Oil and Natural Gas Corp and Oil India Ltd with refiner and retailer Indian Oil Corp, is the first for by Indian energy companies for assets in Canada. It comes as India, which imports about 80 percent of its near&amp;amp;nbsp;four million barrels per day (bpd) oil needs, cuts purchases from major supplier Iran to secure a waiver from US sanctions aimed at curbing Tehran's nuclear ambitions. &amp;quot;We have bid along with Oil India and Indian Oil Corp,&amp;quot; a source at ONGC Videsh, the overseas investment arm of ONGC, told reporters on Monday. A source at Oil India said the bid was submitted at the end of July. In January, ConocoPhillips put stakes in six Alberta properties on the auction block. They produce 12,000 barrels of oil a day from an estimated 30 billion barrels of bitumen. The one producing project in the package is Surmont, run in a joint venture with France's Total SA . Located south of the oil sands hub of Fort McMurray, Alberta, the steam-driven development pumps about 25,000 barrels per day. The partners are working to boost that to 136,000 bpd, starting in 2015. ConocoPhillips declined to comment on the bid from the Indian firms, the timing for announcing the results of the auction, or the overall level of interest. &amp;quot;We do not comment on market rumours,&amp;quot; spokeswoman Davy Kong said. ONGC Chairman Sudhir Vasudeva said on Tuesday the company had not yet made a bid but continued to look at international opportunities. LESS THAN FRUITFUL SEARCH The New Delhi government has told state firms to secure energy assets overseas as the country's own output is well below the needs of its demand in an economy expected to grow 6.5 percent this year and already suffering hefty power shortfalls. But attempts to secure assets have not been very fruitful, even though there is ample cash available. International Coal Ventures Limited (ICVL), a consortium of state-run companies including Steel Authority of India and Coal India , has struggled to buy a single asset in the three years since its inception. Its poor M&amp;amp;amp;A track record mainly stems from bureaucratic sloth as well as differences among the consortium members over ownership issues, said several banking sources who have previously worked with the state-run companies. &amp;quot;In any well-run auction process, Indian state-run companies will be at a disadvantage because they are not very efficient and don't move fast enough,&amp;quot; said a resources M&amp;amp;amp;A banker with a European bank in Mumbai. &amp;quot;When you are a consortium of state-run firms, the entire process becomes very chaotic,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;But energy security is a big theme for India and one good thing is there are not too many buyers for these assets due to global economic conditions.&amp;quot; In February, ONGC and state-run gas transportation company GAIL India Ltd said they were looking at an offer for Britain's Cove Energy but after three months of silence dropped the idea. On their own, Indian energy companies have likewise had little success in closing large overseas acquisitions and tended to focus on individual deals. ONGC Videsh, which is expected to contribute about 46 percent of group production by financial year 2030 with investment of USD 20 billion, has stakes in 30 projects in 15 countries including producing assets in Sudan, South Sudan, Vietnam, Syria, Russia, Colombia, Venezuela and Brazil. It recently bought a 2.7 percent stake of Hess in the large Azeri, Chirag and Guneshli (ACG) group of oil fields in Azerbaijan. Foreign state-owned firms are increasingly looking at Canada's tar sands, the world's third-largest crude source. The Indian interest follows a USD 15.1 billion bid for Calgary-based Nexen Inc by CNOOC Ltd, the Chinese state-owned oil company.

2012-09-24T17:32:05+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,ONGC to invest Rs 11 lakh cr to double production in 18 yrs,"State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) plans to invest about Rs 11 lakh crore to double its production over the next 18 years, company chairman and managing director Sudhir Vasudeva said today.","State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) plans to invest about Rs 11 lakh crore to double its production over the next 18 years, company chairman and managing director Sudhir Vasudeva said today. &amp;quot;We have prepared a 'Perspective Plan 2030' that envisages doubling production over the next 18 years at 4-5 per cent annual production growth rate,&amp;quot; he told reporters here. The so-called 'blue print' targets doubling production while achieving a three-fold growth in revenue and profits. It also aims for a four-fold growth in market capitalisation of the company and a six-fold growth in production from international operations, he said.  &amp;quot;All this will require an investment of Rs 11,00,000 crore,&amp;quot; he said. ONGC in 2011-12 fiscal produced 23.71 million tonnes of oil and 23.32 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas. It posted a net profit of Rs 25,123 crore on a turnover of Rs 76,130 crore.  At today's closing price of Rs 287.30 per share, it had a market capitalisation of Rs 2.45 lakh crore. Its overseas arm, ONGC Videsh Ltd produced 6.21 million tonnes of oil and 2.54 bcm of gas in 2011-12. Vasudeva said while ONGC would look to unlock 450 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas from yet to be found domestic resources, OVL has been tasked to source 60 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas per year by 2030. &amp;quot;We have decided to invest and explore opportunities in 4-5 international hubs, where OVL can atain growth of sufficient scale. Potential growth hubs include heavy oil, conventional plays, shale and deepwater,&amp;quot; he said. Also, ONGC plans to force alliances for development of new rsources like shale gas, coal-bed methane (CBM), deeper palys and HP/HT (high pressure and high temperature) reservoirs.  &amp;quot;We have signed a MoU with ConocoPhillips, a US oil major and pioneers in shale gas and deepwater exploration, in March 2012 for cooperation in the reas of shale gas exploration in India, USA and elsewhere in the world; and also deepwater in India. &amp;quot;We also signed a MoU with China National petroleum Corp (CNPC), a world-leading integrated international energy company, in June 2012 to have cooperation in hydrocarbon sector including midstream and downstream&amp;quot; he said.  Stating that considerable potential exist in Indian basins, Vasudeva said ONGC's existing portfolio contains yet-to-develop discoveries that can add more than 300 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas of production by 2030.  &amp;quot;A number of fields have been identified for priority accelerated development,&amp;quot; he said, adding ONGC also plans to invest in the non-E&amp;amp;amp;P sector. &amp;quot;These investments will include expansion and further petrochemical integration at the MRPL refinery, additional LNG re-gasification, commercialisation of stranged gas and capacity in alternative energy generation including solar, wind and potentially nuclear,&amp;quot; he said. Vasudeva said ONGC in 2011-12 shelled-out Rs 44,466 crore to subsidise diesel, cooking gas (LPG) and kerosene. This impacted the company's net profit by Rs 25,535 crore. Till date, ONGC has paid Rs 166,915 crore in fuel subsidiy, denting its profit by Rs 97,064 crore.

Approval is being delayed due to defence, environment and maritime boundary issues, Petroleum and Natural Gas minister S. Jaipal Reddy said. Of the blocks awaiting approvals, 22 belong to Oil and Natural Gas Corp, 15 to Reliance Industries, five to BHP Billiton, three to Cairn Energy India and two to Australia's Santos Ltd. British firms BG Group, BP and Italy's ENI own one each. Reddy said clearances for larger areas from which these blocks are carved out are obtained from concerned ministries before auctioning them. Contractors then need approvals from the defence, environment and forest, and foreign ministries as well as the relevant state governments to start or continue exploration or production work. The firms have invested USD 12.4 billion for exploration and development activities in the blocks, Reddy told lawmakers in a written reply. The world's fourth biggest oil importer, India wants to tap domestic supply to cut its ballooning import bill and widening fiscal deficit. Its crude oil import bill surged 48% to Rs 672000 crore&amp;amp;nbsp;in the year to March due to rising global oil prices, declining rupee and expanding refining capacity. The economy is growing at its slowest pace in nearly a decade and policy paralysis has stalled major reforms including those on fuel pricing, denting global investors' confidence in the Indian oil sector. In 2010, Brazil's Petrobras and Norway's Statoil exited from a block operated by ONGC in the hydrocarbon-rich Krishna Godavari Basin off India's east coast. India, which imports about 80% of its oil needs, has awarded 249 blocks under nine licensing rounds since 1999.

The government had offered 34 areas for exploration and production of oil and gas in NELP-IX in 2010 and bids for 33 were received at the close of bidding on March 28 last year. Of these, CCEA in March awarded 16 blocks to firms like ONGC while bids for 10 blocks were rejected due to bidders offering lesser than expected profit petroleum. The CCEA at its meeting scheduled this evening approved award of five more blocks, Oil Minister S Jaipal Reddy told reporters here. In all the CCEA was to consider award of six onland and two offshore blocks but only five blocks were approved, he said but did not give reasons for not awarding three blocks. Mumbai basin deepsea block MB-DWN-2010/1 was awarded to consortium of UK's BG Exploration &amp;amp;amp; Production Ltd and BHP Billiton Petroleum (International Exploration) Pty Ltd of Australia. BG-BHP combine beat a consortia of Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), Oil India Ltd (OIL) and GAIL to the block. Shallow water block MB-OSN-2010/2 in the same basin is due to be awarded to a consortium of OIL, Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petro Resources Ltd, who were the sole bidders. Sources said the required clearance from the Ministry of Defence had been received for exploration in the two offshore blocks. Earlier, the two Mumbai basin blocks could not be awarded to the first ranked bidders as there was no defence clearance. The Assam-Arakam basin onshore block AA ONN-2010/1 went to a consortium of Prize Petroleum and ABG Energy.  In the previous eight rounds of NELP, 235 blocks were awarded. The 34 exploration blocks offered in NELP-IX included eight deepwater blocks, seven shallow water blocks, 11 on-land blocks, and 8 Type-S (or small) on-land blocks. In March, state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) cornered six blocks - four as operator and two as minority partner, but saw its bids rejected for 8 areas including five deep-sea blocks. Based on recommendations of an Empowered Committee of Secretaries (ECS), the CCEA was to consider rejecting bids of Ishar Gasoil Pvt Ltd for three blocks for failure to meet networth criteria. Ishar Gasoil was top bidder for Rajasthan&amp;amp;nbsp; block RJ-ONN-2010/1, Ganga Valley block GV-ONN-2010/1 and Cambay basin block CB-ONN-2010/2. But the CCEA did not consider awarding the blocks to the next highest bidder as Ishar Gasoil had moved court against the&amp;amp;nbsp; ECS recommendation. &amp;quot;The proposal for three blocks RJ-ONN-2010/1, CB-ONN-2010/2 and GV-ONN-2010/1 could not be placed before CCEA for consideration due to filing of Writ Petition by Ishar Gasoil Pvt Ltd,&amp;quot; an official statement issued here said. Since Ishar Gasoil was sole bidder for GV-ONN-2010/1, this block as per ECS was not be awarded at all. The Rajasthan block was to go to the next highest bidder, a consortium of GAIL, Bharat PetroResources Ltd (BPRL), BF Infrastructure Ltd and Monnet Ispat &amp;amp;amp; Energy Ltd. A consortium led by Deep Energy was to get the Cambay block. Sankalp Oil and Natural Resources which was awarded three blocks by CCEA in March, had not signed contract for two Cambay basin blocks. Because of this, the CCEA decided to cancel award of CB-ONN-2010/9 and CB-ONN-2010/8 blocks to Sankalp and awarding them to next highest bidders -- ONGC and a consortia of BPRL, GAIL, Engineers India, BF Infrastructure and Monnet&amp;amp;nbsp; respectively.

Cairn, which is currently producing 1,75,000 barrels oil per day from its Rajasthan blocks, expects the potential production of 3,00,000 barrels oil every day. Based on the revised estimates, the total Rajasthan resource base now supports a potential production of 3,00,000 barrels of oil per day, subject to government approvals and our joint venture partner ONGC and further investment, Agarwal said. The said production level is equivalent to over 35 per cent of the domestic current crude oil production, which will help reduce the annual import bill by over USD 10 billion and contribute annual revenue of USD 5 billion to the government, he said. Commenting on its overseas operations, Agarwal said, the company is expanding its international footprint following initial success in Sri Lanka. The innovative geological studies aided by 3D seismic data led to two discoveries in the frontier Mannar Basin off Sri Lanka. The company has now entered the second phase of exploration and intends to commence drilling in mid 2013. The company has also successfully acquired a 60 percent stake from Petro SA in an oil and gas exploration block on the West Coast of South Africa. Cairn India would be the operator in the block, while PetroSA, owned by the government of that country, would hold the remaining interest, Cairn India outgoing managing and chief executive Rahul Dhir said. _PAGEBREAK_ The block would be an anchor exploration asset in South Africa, and would augment Cairn India's existing portfolio. We expect gas discoveries in South Africa and our commitment is to bring the best technology, Dhir said. Cairn India was constrained for exploration all these years, and now we are encouraging exploration potential abroad and South Africa is first step. The company's strategic goal of growing its resource base by acquiring exploration and appraisal assets not only in India but also outside Indiansub-continent, Agarwal said. Elaborating on Rajasthan Refinery proposal, Agarwal said, Cairn India may get invited to take minority stake in the proposed refinery.

GAIL had in 2008-09 picked up 19 per cent stake in ONGC Petro-additions Ltd (OPaL) which is building a mega petrochemical complex at Dahej in Gujarat. The 1.1 million tonnes plant was at that time estimated to cost Rs 12,440 crore but the project cost was in 2010 revised to Rs 19,535 crore. But now Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), the principal promoter of OPaL, has further revised the cost upward to Rs 21,396 crore with December 2013 set as the commissioning date, sources privy to the development said. GAIL, a Navaratna PSU, had originally decided to pick up 19 per cent in the project but when project cost was revised to Rs 19,535 crore, it decided to restrict its participation to 17%. This was done because the company board had powers to approve an investment of only up to Rs 1,000 crore. Consequently, it decided to make an equity contribution of Rs 996.28 crore towards the 17% stake, they said. But now that the project cost has gone up by a further, the promoters equity contribution has increased from Rs 5860.5 crore to Rs 6,418.8 crore at 70:30 debt-equity ratio. GAIL, sources said, is not inclined to make any additional equity contribution and has decided to cap its investment in OPaL at the capital it has already approved -- Rs 996.28 crore. This in in the revised project cost wouldfetch it only 15.5 per cent stake. Sources said GAIL would however continue to hold rights to market 38% of the polymer and other chemicals produced by OPaL even at the reduced equity stake. ONGC holds 26% stake in OPaL and has to make Rs 1,668.88 crore equity contribution. Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) holds 5% while the remaining 53.5% equity or Rs 3,434.05 crore is yet to be tied up. Sources said ONGC had initially decided to make an equity contribution of Rs 970.32 crore for a 26% stake in OPaL. But at the latest project cost, it will have to make Rs 1,668.88 crore contribution for the same amount of stake. ONGC, which has advanced the date of commercial operation by a year to December 2013, has reasoned the increase in project cost primarily to additional cost of Phase-II captive power plant and increase in cost of building the Phase-I electricity generating unit. GSPC, a government of Gujarat nominee, has communicated that it would like to retain its 5% stake in OPaL but its total contribution till date is Rs 29 crore only. At the revised cost, it has to make an equity contribution of Rs 320.94 crore.

This is in contrast to its flat production at 61mtoe during FY07-12.&rdquo;  &ldquo;The current decline in crude oil prices is beneficial for ONGC as its realization on crude oil goes up.

At 40% share of upstream share in subsidies, ONGC&rsquo;s net realization on crude oil ranges between US&amp;amp;#36;64/bbl-US&amp;amp;#36;53/bbl for a crude oil price range of US&amp;amp;#36;80/bbl-US&amp;amp;#36;120/bbl. Given the precarious financial status of the government, it has no choice but to take up policy measures to tackle subsidy issue.

We expect oil prices to remain subdued ahead on the back of weak oil demand fundamentals globally. Any price hike will have a substantial impact on ONGC and provide valuation upsides.&rdquo;  &ldquo;We initiate coverage on ONGC with Accumulate rating given its production growth ahead and likely government action on the fuel subsidy front.

The court had issued a notice to Centre and the companies on April 27 but they failed to file their responses on a PIL seeking a CBI probe into the reasons for ONGC and government in &amp;quot;not asserting&amp;quot; their legal rights on the issue. The bench said it would be difficut to reverse the deal but it would look into the allegation after a response is filed in the case. &amp;quot;We will take note of what has happened,&amp;quot; the bench said. The bench was hearing a PIL filed by a Bangalore resident Arun Kumar Agarwal who alleged there was a clause in an agreement between Cairn group and ONGC that in case Cairn Group wanted to sell its shares in Cairn India, it would first offer the same to ONGC. As per the clause, Cairn could sell its shares to other parties only after ONGC refused to buy the stake and ONGC, thus, had the right of first refusal (ROFR), he said. The petition alleged the decision on the deal had been made on &amp;quot;extraneous considerations&amp;quot; and without taking into account the relevant aspects. The petition said had ONGC, which was Cairn India's joint venture partner, been offered its ROFR for Cairn India's shares and had it exercised its right, the exchequer would have benefitted by over Rs 1 lakh crore.","Arun Kumar Agarwal, Bangalore, Business, Cairn, D K Jain, Madan B Lokur, ONGC, Supreme Court, Vedanta","Arun Kumar Agarwal, Bangalore, Business, Cairn, D K Jain, Madan B Lokur, ONGC, Supreme Court, Vedanta",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/it-will-be-difficult-to-reverse-cairn-vedanta-deal-sc_734194.html

This, along with the 4.2 bn boe of discovered oil in-place supports our vision of producing 300,000 bpd,&amp;quot; he said in the company's annual report released today. Company Chairman Navin Agarwal said production potential of 300,000 bpd was &amp;quot;subject to further investments and approvals from our joint venture partner, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and the Government of India.&amp;quot; &amp;amp;nbsp;Agarwal, in his first year as Chairman of Cairn India, said despite the current economic uncertainties, the outlook for oil price remains good and &amp;quot;we are preserving our investment trajectory.&amp;quot; Billionaire Anil Agarwal-led mining group Vedanta Resources last year bought majority stake in Cairn India from its British promoters, Cairn Energy plc. Anil Agarwal has not taken a board position in Cairn India and has instead appointed his brother Navin to head the firm. &amp;quot;With the much needed correct alignment between the company on the one hand, and its Rajasthan JV partner, ONGC, and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, I am confident that more will happen in the years to come,&amp;quot; Dhir said. &amp;quot;Just as I am confident that the new majority shareholder, the Vedanta Group, will do all that is necessary to accelerate growth, seek new assets, develop greater exploration potential, and create an even more robustfoundation for an enterprise that the country can, and should,be proud of,&amp;quot; he said. Cairn India currently produces just over 175,000 bpd or 8.75 million tonnes a year from Mangala and Bhagyam oilfields in the Barmer block in Rajasthan. It has permission to raise output to 235,000 bpd (11.75 million tons) from Mangala, Bhagyam and Aishwariya or MBA fields. It currently produces 150,000 bpd from Mangala and about 25,000 bpd from Bhagyam field. Bhagyam had an approved peak of 40,000 bpd, but the field has under-performed and there was a need to drill more wells. &amp;amp;nbsp;The company has secured an approval to raise the peak output from Bhagyam to 60,000 bpd, while that of Aishwariya, the third biggest oil field in the Rajasthan block, to 25,000 bpd from previously stated 10,000 bpd.

ONGC intends to make a total investment of INR11t over 2013- 2030 against INR2.65t under the 12th plan (2012-17). It has an aspiration to increase production of its overseas subsidiary, ONGC Videsh Limited (OVL), six-fold from the current ~8mmt to 60mmt by 2030. Further, it wishes to diversify into downstream businesses and aspires to achieve 30% of group revenue from non-E&amp;amp;amp;P (Exploration and Production) businesses. Its diversification plan involves investments in alternate energy, LNG capacity and petrochemicals.&rdquo;  &ldquo;ONGC has sustained domestic production in the last decade, despite no major discovery. Its mature fields (both offshore and onshore) are declining at a steep rate of ~7%. ONGC has successfully completed 16 out of 22 planned IOR/ EOR (Improved/Enhanced Oil Recovery) projects, with total investment of INR284b, yielding total incremental production of 72mmt up to FY12. ONGC expects to increase its gas production to 100mmscmd by 2016-17, led by the development of its deepwater fields in KG basin and Daman offshore. ONGC believes that ad-hoc subsidy sharing is nearterm risk. Given India's energy needs, the government will have to take steps to reduce uncertainty so as to allow upstream companies to fully realize their value. Further, the company is hopeful of government actions to reduce subsidy burden by way of partial decontrol of petroleum products, targeted subsidy and price hikes. Given the precarious government finances and easing of inflationary pressure, ONGC believes that sector reforms are in the offing.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Low crude oil price regime augurs well for ONGC, as it reduces overall subsidy significantly. However, the current decline in crude oil prices is offset by the rupee depreciation. Likely price hikes in controlled products in the near term, and subsidy rationalization and production growth in the long term, are the key positives for the company. The stock is attractive: (a) &amp;amp;gt;40% discount to its global peers on EV/BOE (1P basis), and (b) implied dividend yield of ~3.5%. ONGC trades at 10.3x FY13E EPS of INR27.3.

According to the research firm, for 1QFY2013, net sales of companies are expected to increase broadly, mainly driven by higher volume growth.","Angel Broking has come with its June quarterly earning estimates for oil &amp;amp;amp; gas sector. According to the research firm, for 1QFY2013, net sales of companies are expected to increase broadly, mainly driven by higher volume growth. During 1QFY2013, average Brent crude oil price fell by 8.7% qoq on account of adverse news flow from the troubled Eurozone. Further, average WTI crude oil price decreased by 9.3%, broadly reflecting the fall in Brent crude oil price. Henry Hub natural gas price declined by 5.6% qoq due to rising production of shale gas (thus rising inventories) and warmer summer. However, Asian spot LNG prices continued to remain high on account of demand-supply mismatch in Asia. Prices of petrochemical products, on the other hand, remained flat on a qoq basis during 1QFY2013. During April and May 2012, Indian crude oil basket for oil prices stood at US&amp;amp;#36;118/bbl and US&amp;amp;#36;108/bbl, respectively. Despite INR depreciation against the USD, the steep decline has resulted in lower under-recoveries for oil marketing companies (OMCs) on account of selling diesel, kerosene and domestic LPG at subsidized rates. During the first half of June 2012, OMCs continued to lose Rs 446cr per day compared to Rs 563cr per day in April 2012. OMCs continued to lose Rs 10.2/liter, Rs 30.5/liter and Rs 396/cylinder on diesel, kerosene and domestic LPG, respectively, during the first half of June 2012. Mixed 1QFY2013 performance by O&amp;amp;amp;G stocksDuring 1QFY2013, BSE Oil and Gas (O&amp;amp;amp;G) Index recorded a moderate decrease of 0.5%, although BSE Sensex was positive by 0.1%. After a rise during 4QFY2012, oil and gas stocks again fell during April and May 2012, in-line with the fall in broader markets. However, the stocks increased during June 2012. Cairn India stock fell steeply on June 29, 2012, after Cairn Energy sold its 3.5% stake by way of bulk deal in the open market. RIL stock fell during April and May 2012, but increased in June 2012 due to the ongoing buyback program by promoters. GAIL stock declined during 1QFY2013, reflecting the decrease in KG-D6 gas production and higher international gas prices. ONGC was the outperformer in the oil and gas sector. The stock increased substantially in June 2012, after it posted better-than-expected 4QFY2012 results. 1QFY2013 expectationsFor 1QFY2013, we expect net sales of companies under our coverage to increase broadly, mainly driven by higher volume growth. We expect ONGC's net sales to increase by 20.2% yoy on account of higher realization. ONGC's PAT is expected to increase by 31.4% yoy. For RIL, we expect the top line to decrease modestly by 0.2%. However, its bottom line is expected to decrease by 28.0% yoy mainly due to lower production from KG-D6 block. GAIL is expected to report 20.7% yoy topline growth on account of higher volumes. However, its net profit is expected to decrease by 23.0% yoy due to higher interest and depreciation expenses.

Acute shortage of coal for power projects as well as worsening health of distribution companies (discoms) remain major worries for the sector. &amp;quot;The government's and companies' continued inability to address the challenges in the power sector may result in significant NPLs (Non Performing Loans) in banking sector over the next 2-3 years,&amp;quot; brokerage firm Kotak Securities has said. In a recent report, the entity noted that new power projects having a total capacity of 40-50 GW could be in danger of defaulting on their debt obligations. &amp;quot;We estimate the banking system's exposure (including loans from PFC and REC) to the power sector will rise to Rs 9 trillion (Rs 9 lakh crore) by the end of FY 2015 from Rs 5.3 trillion (Rs 5.3 lakh crore) at the end of FY 2012 (19% CAGR in FY 2012-15E),&amp;quot; the report noted. PFC and REC are leading state-run lenders to the power sector. Pointing out that the central government's effort to address coal-supply and pricing challenges &amp;quot;is quite timid,&amp;quot; it said that a sharp rise is expected in NPLs in power generation sector as well as increase in SEB (State Electricity Board) losses over the next 2-3 years. &amp;quot;We see several new power generation projects as being unable to meet their debt obligations. Banks may not recognise them as NPLs under various guises but the magnitude of the problem is too large for any quick-fix solution,&amp;quot; it said. Even though, the government is taking initiatives to ease fuel supply scenario for the power sector, many existing and upcoming projects are faced with severe coal shortage. Amid rising concerns about defaults in the banking system, the government is working on plans to restructure the debtburden of state discoms. The precarious health of discoms has been mainly blamed on lower tariff realisation and efficiency issues.","banking, Business, debt, discoms, NPL, PFC, power sector, SEB","banking, Business, debt, discoms, NPL, PFC, power sector, SEB",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/banks-power-sector-exposure-may-touch-rs-9-lakh-cr-by-fy15_722797.html

In FY12, the oil production from the company's domestic fields declined 2.9% Y-o-Y to 23.71 mmt, on account of the natural decline; however, gas production increased 1.0% Y-o-Y to 23.32 bcm. It should be noted that, in FY12, the IOR/EOR techniques resulted in an incremental gain of 8 mmt of oil. By FY12, ONGC had accrued ~72 mmt of incremental gain and envisages cumulative gain of 171 mmt. We expect the revenue to grow at a CAGR of 9.1% over FY12-14E to Rs. 1753.1 bn, however EBIDTA is expected to increase at a modest CAGR of 5.4% during the same period as the EBIDTA margin likely to remain under pressure on account of costs pressures and lower net crude oil realization. The increase in the cess burden has increased the cost of production from &amp;amp;#36; 38 / bbl to &amp;amp;#36; 44 / bbl.

The idea of making ONGC a diversified firm with interest across the entire energy value chain was Raha's brainchild. The company, after Sudhir Vasudeva took as the Chairman and Managing Director last year, has again revived the diversification plan and is now actively looking at setting up LNG terminal at Mangalore to meet the fast growing energy needs in the country, sources privy to the development said. ONGC plans to sign an agreement with Mitsui to explore opportunities for setting up a LNG terminal in India, specifically at Mangalore, or at any other mutually identified locations, they said, adding the duo would also market theimported fuel. Sources said ONGC wants to use Mitsui's 30 years of global experience to source LNG. A gas-based power plant may also be set up at a later stage.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Besides, the two would also explore opportunities of joint bidding for forthcoming exploration rounds, such as NELP (New Exploration License Policy) and Shale Gas Blocks. Sources said ONGC feels domestic gas availability at 197 million standard cubic meters per day in 2015-16 will be way short of a demand of 290 mmscmd. The balance demand of 93 mmscmd would have to be met through imported LNG (24.8 milliontonnes per annum). Considering the huge potential demand of LNG, ONGC wants to join the race for setting up LNG terminal.&amp;amp;nbsp;The country now has two operational LNG import facilities 10 million tonnes unit at Dahej in Gujarat operated by Petronet LNG Ltd and a 3.6 million tonnes terminal of Shell-Total at Hazira. Another 5 million tonnes facility is almost complete at Dabhol in Maharashtra, while Petronet is building an equal size terminal at Kochi in Kerala by the year end.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; State-owned gas utility GAIL India and Petronet plan to set up separate import facilities on the east coast. Shell has teamed up with Reliance Power for a floating LNG terminal off the Andhra coast while Indian Oil Corp (IOC) is doing studies for a terminal at Ennore in Tamil Nadu.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Sources said ONGC too wants to be part of the LNG business and it see Mitsui as the vehicle for entry into the lucrative business.

Net sales for the quarter rose by 22.2% qoq &amp;amp;amp; 3.8% yoy to Rs. 18,819.3 crore. Net Realizations in dollar terms rose by 14.7% to USD 44.32 /bbl while that in rupee grew by robust 27.1% to Rs 2229 crore helped by the depreciation.&rdquo; &ldquo;During the quarter, ONGC shelled out Rs 14,170 crore towards fuel subsidy as against 12,136 crore in Q4FY11. The total subsidy burden for the year stood at Rs 44,466 crore. It is learnt that, the upstream companies bore 40% instead of the previous 38% of the total under-recovery with subsidy calculated on the basis of the quantity of crude sold. GoI ad hoc subsidy sharing mechanism remains a big overhang on the stock. With no information from the government on the future sharing mechanism and up-ticking crude prices, we expect the upstream companies to continue to bear 40% of the under recoveries going forward. Considering the huge capex plans, we expect the huge subsidy burden to mar ONGC&rsquo;s financial health.&rdquo;&amp;amp;nbsp;  &ldquo;Driven by the higher crude prices, ONGC gross realization stood at &amp;amp;#36; 121.64 per barrel v/s &amp;amp;#36; 108.9 per barrel, up by 11.7% yoy. However, post discount to the OMCs, net realization stood lower at &amp;amp;#36; 44.32 per barrel v/s &amp;amp;#36; 38.75 per barrel, up by 27.1% yoy.&rdquo; During the quarter, higher depletion, depreciation and amortization (DD&amp;amp;amp;A) cost at Rs 1349.3 crore down by 41.5% yoy on account of lower write offs of the dry wells and one-off item of Rs 700 crore on account of depreciation of the pipeline in Q4FY11. The company made 3 discoveries during the quarter. Taking the total discoveries to 23, for the full year. OVL, ONGC overseas subsidiary, reported revenue of Rs 22,637 crore for FY12 as against Rs 18,671 crore in FY11 led by higher realizations as production dipped to 8.75 mtoe v/s 9.45 mtoe in FY11. The profit after tax stood at Rs 2,721 crore, up by meager 1.1% over 2,691 crore in FY11 on account of impairment of Rs 1953 crore w.r.t to Imperial Energy, as the asset is performing lower than the estimated value due to complexities in exploration.&rdquo; &ldquo;OVL which derives almost 40% of its revenue from Sudan, Syria and Imperial Energy, is facing constant issues one after the other, keeping production under check. Imperial Energy continues to face reservoir issues thus capping its production at current levels of 14,000 bpd. In addition, the political tensions between Sudan North and Sudan South have triggered a production loss of 0.5MMT during FY12 and are currently producing at a rate of 40,000 bpd. Declining production in the domestic fields and restricted production at OVL has led to negative volume growth for ONGC. However, the management seems confident of achieving high growth in the next years backed by EOR activities in the domestic assets. In addition to restricted growth in production, lack of policy action by the government on the rising under recoveries remains an overhang on the stock. Increase in upstream companies share in under recoveries from 33% a year back to 40% now, further adds to the blow.&rdquo;  &ldquo;With lack of political support to the government, any hike in diesel prices or partial de regulation can be ruled out. Led by these concerns, we expect the stock to remain under pressure in the near term. However considering ONGC reserves and strong perspective plan 2030, we remain bullish on the long term potential of the stock and we expect both the domestic and international production to improve. Further, we expect the temporary issues with OVL to be resolved over a period of time further enhancing OVL&rsquo;s production. Currently, the stock is trading below the mean band of its historical valuations at 8.3x and 7.9x its FY13 and FY14 consensus earnings estimates, we recommend a BUY on the stock,&rdquo; says Ventura research report.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;  Public holding more than 90% in Indian cos  Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

2012-06-05T13:12:03+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,"Cash piles up at RIL, growth cycle slowing?","Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries is piling up cash even as its profits shrink, fuelling investor disquiet over a tumbling share price and lack of clear vision at a company that was once India's most valuable.","Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries is piling up cash even as its profits shrink, fuelling investor disquiet over a tumbling share price and lack of clear vision at a company that was once India's most valuable. Reliance generates up to USD 1 billion in free cash every quarter and held USD 13.8 billion at end-March, far more than it can put to work under existing investment plans or through an ongoing share buyback programme. &amp;quot;Earlier, investors gave them the benefit of doubt that cash was being deployed in high-margin businesses, but people are questioning that now,&amp;quot; said Michiel van Voorst, a portfolio manager for Asia-Pacific Equities at Robeco Hong Kong. Those questions are likely to get an airing at the company's annual shareholder's meeting on Thursday. Reliance has cooled in its hunt for acquisitions in North American shale gas as US natural gas prices have plunged. At home, investment in its gas blocks has stalled as output slows and it battles the government over gas pricing. The company has so far acquired less than a quarter of the USD 2.1 billion of shares it plans to buy back from investors, even as it raises debt to take advantage of low borrowing costs. Reliance makes much of its plans to spend USD 12 billion over the next few years to boost capacity at its petrochemicals plant and refinery complex, the world's largest, in western India. However, such projects are typically funded about 70% from debt, which leaves plenty of low-yielding cash left over. Last year, Ambani outlined a big drive into consumer-focused businesses, looking to take advantage of rising spending power in Asia's third-largest economy. The problem for investors is that the retail business is loss-making even after six years and Reliance is spending billions to get into a fiercely competitive and unpredictable telecoms sector, with returns a distant and uncertain prospect. &amp;quot;I think most investors feel Reliance should concentrate and not go everywhere, not diversify in every direction,&amp;quot; said Taina Erajuuri, portfolio manager at FIM India in Helsinki. &amp;quot;They've been burning cash on some investments, which I'm not happy (about),&amp;quot; added Erajuuri, who has sold her Reliance shares in the past year. FALLING RETURNS Reliance is widely credited with having one of the savviest treasury operations in corporate India. As returns have dwindled from core businesses, the proportion of profits from its treasury has surged, accounting for as much as 42% in the March quarter, roughly triple the share until a year ago. Return on capital slipped to 11.4% in January-March from 13.8% two years ago. While the slowdown in its energy businesses contributed to that decline, treasury gains also weigh on returns. Its cash pile is about three times what it was two years ago, following the USD 7.2 billion sale last year of 30% in some of its oil and gas blocks to BP Plc. The bulk of Reliance's cash, held in bank deposits, corporate debt and government securities, has an estimated return of 9-11%. The interest cost on its long-term borrowings is 6-8%, giving it treasury gains of around 3 percentage points. The cash hoard has not deterred Reliance from raising more debt. Last month, it raised USD 2 billion in a 13-year loan, taking its debt raisings in the last four months to nearly USD 4 billion and increasing its gross debt to USD 15.4 billion. It is seeking another USD 1 billion loan for capital spending, sources told Thomson Reuters publication Basis Point. &amp;quot;They're generating more profit from cash than from exploration, and almost equal to gains from refining,&amp;quot; said SP Tulsian, an independent market strategist in Mumbai. &amp;quot;Even if these returns are good, is it a comfortable situation?&amp;quot; END OF GROWTH CYCLE? At this week's AGM, Ambani could face questions on the gradually weakening performance in the company's core energy businesses, and on the lack of profits from its push into consumer-focused businesses. Its retail business continues to lose money and, despite 1,300 stores, the company is nowhere close to the scale it aimed for at the time of its launch. Reliance is also spending heavily on telecoms and in January invested in TV18 media group. Investors complain Reliance is looking to bet its future, and its cash, on newer businesses that have long gestation periods, and may see returns flow only after 4-5 years. They are voting with their feet. Reliance shares fell by a third last year. The stock trades near a three-year low and its market value has sunk to below USD 41 billion, dumping Ambani from the top of Asia's rich-list. Tata Consultancy Services, part of arch-rival Tata Group, has unseated it as India's most valuable listed company. Sluggish global growth and a tough regulatory and investment climate at home mean many Indian firms such as Coal India, Oil and Natural Gas Corp and Infosys have shunned deals and now sit on mounting cash. Reliance's cash-pile is not far short of much larger global energy majors such as Shell with USD 15 billion, Chevron with USD 18.8 billion and Exxon Mobil with USD 21.8 billion. Apple Inc has a record USD 110 billion in cash. &amp;quot;Globally, you're seeing many oil and gas companies giving very high dividends. But that also means admitting they have come to the end of a high growth cycle,&amp;quot; said Robeco's van Voorst. &amp;quot;I don't know if Reliance is willing to admit that.&amp;quot;","Business, Mukesh Ambani, Reliance Industries, shale gas, Tata Consultancy Services, US natural gas","Business, Mukesh Ambani, Reliance Industries, shale gas, Tata Consultancy Services, US natural gas",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cash-pilesat-ril-growth-cycle-slowing_713663.html

The Houston-based company has been looking to sell assets in a number of countries including Nigeria as part of a global restructuring. ConocoPhillips recently completed the spin-off of its refining activities into Phillips 66, a newly created independent US company. ConocoPhillips said in January that it is selling a stake in six Alberta properties that produce 12,000 barrels of oil a day from an estimated 30 billion barrels of bitumen. Asked whether ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of ONGC, was interested in buying the assets, the source said: &amp;quot;It's in the process. It is seriously looking at it.&amp;quot; The first round of bids is due soon and there is likely to be competition from other international parties, including possible Chinese interest, said the source. State-run Oil India is also looking to buy stakes in ConocoPhillips' oil sand assets in Canada, its head of finance said last week. Of the six projects offered, only Surmont, run in a joint venture with France's Total SA , is producing oil. Lo cated south of the oil sands hub of Fort McMurray, Alberta, the steam-driven development pumps about 25,000 barrels a day. The partners are working to boost that to 136,000 bpd, starting in 2015.

GAIL said fourth-quarter net profit fell 38%, missing analysts' forecasts, due to an increase in discounts given to state-run refining companies to compensate for a shortfall from government-set retail prices of cooking gas. The planned capital spending for the current financial year is roughly similar to 2011-12 and will be funded by raising Rs 4500 crore&amp;amp;nbsp;through debt. GAIL will launch a local bond issue of up to Rs 750 crore&amp;amp;nbsp;by next week, and plans to raise another USD 300 million through external commercial borrowings, chairman B.C. Tripathi told reporters. A growing number of power plants, industries, and city gas projects have pushed up natural gas demand in Asia's third largest economy, but problems at Reliance Industries's gas blocks, off India's east coast, have forced higher imports of expensive liquefied natural gas (LNG). To cater for the rising demand, GAIL is adding 5,500 kilometres of pipelines to its existing 9,000 kms network. The company, which is gradually branching out from its primarily gas transmission business into a major petrochemicals and LNG player, has outlined plans to spend nearly USD 5.5 billion on capacity expansion over the next four years. GAIL plans to import around 30 spot cargoes of LNG, Tripathi said. Q4 PROFIT SHARPLY DOWN GAIL reported net profit of Rs 483 crore&amp;amp;nbsp;for its fiscal fourth quarter ended March 31, down from Rs 783 crore a year earlier. Net sales, however, rose 17% to Rs 10454 crore. Analysts, on average, had expected a net profit of Rs 880 crore, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. GAIL provided discounts of Rs 1398 crore&amp;amp;nbsp;during the quarter, compared to Rs 901 crore&amp;amp;nbsp;a year earlier. India caps prices of petroleum products such as diesel, cooking gas and kerosene and producers such as ONGC and GAIL share the cost of subsidising refineries by selling oil and gas to them at a discount. State oil companies last week raised retail gasoline prices by Rs 7.54 per litre, but the government, faced with street protests, is yet to take a decision on diesel, cooking gas an d kerosene. Shares in GAIL, valued by the market at USD 7.6 billion, closed 1.4% lower at Rs 325.20&amp;amp;nbsp;ahead of the results in a weak Mumbai market.

The terminal, which will have a capacity of 6 million standard cubic meters per day, will receive gas from ONGC's Vashistha and S1 fields in Bay of Bengal, Technip said in a statement. The Vashistha and S1 fields are located 30-35 km off the Amalapuram coast in the KG Basin, off the East Coast at water depths of 250 to 700 meters. &amp;quot;The onshore terminal awarded to Technip is one of the critical components of the Integrated Development of Vashistha and S1 fields,&amp;quot; the statement said. Technip's scope of work for this contract includes basic design, detailed engineering, procurement, fabrication, inspection and testing, installation, pre-commissioning and commissioning of the new onshore terminal facilities which will be integrated to the existing terminal. The hydrocarbons extracted from Vashistha and S1 deep water offshore fields will be transported to the proposed onshore oil and gas terminal for processing. The facility consists of a slug catcher for well fluid separation, gas compressors, high integrity pressure protection system (HIPPS), glycol dehydration, dew point control, mono ethylene glycol regeneration and gas metering system. It also includes utilities and off-sites such as air compression, nitrogen generation, flare system, storage tanks and diesel generators. Technip's operating centre in Delhi will manage and execute the project, which is scheduled to be completed in the second half of 2016, it said. Nicoletta Giadrossi, President of Technip, said: &amp;quot;The Vashistha project represents an important milestone for Technip's operations in India. We will leverage our long experience and track record in the country to deliver this project for ONGC, with whom we are looking forward to further strengthen our strategic collaboration in the future.&amp;quot; Samik Mukherjee, Managing Director and Country Head of Technip in India, stated this is the firm's second contract from ONGC following the Heera Redevelopment process platform project.","Andhra Pradesh, Business, Nicoletta Giadrossi, Odalarevu, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Technip, Vashistha","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Odalarevu,Andhra Pradesh,Vashistha,Technip,Nicoletta Giadrossi",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-awards-100-mln-euro-contract-to-french-firm-technip_1255308.html

Sources said the disinvestment department wants clarity on the CBI probe and the Supreme Court verdict in Hindustan Zinc (HZL) case, while for Balco the valuation report is still awaited. &amp;quot;For HZL, there is a case pending in the Supreme Court and more clarity is needed. It is going to take some time before a decision can be taken,&amp;quot; a source said. Also, the Disinvestment Department is yet to receive the valuation report of both the companies, the source added. The government currently holds 29.5 percent stake in HZL and 49 percent in Balco. During 2001-03 period, the government had sold majority stakes in the two erstwhile PSUs to Vedanta Group. &amp;quot;We are first eyeing ONGC and Coal India. If we are comfortable with the proceeds, we might not go in for residual stake sale as only three months are left,&amp;quot; the source said. The Disinvestment Department plans to sell 5 percent stake in ONGC and 10 per cent in Coal India in January-March quarter. ONGC stake sale could fetch about Rs 17,000 crore and CIL around Rs 20,000 crore at current market prices. The government had budgeted to collect Rs 15,000 crore through sale of residual stake in private companies in current fiscal. Higher excise mop-up from petrol and diesel and decline in oil import bill on account of sharp decline in international crude oil prices could bring savings to the government kitty. &amp;quot;The government may not rush in for residual stake sales at this moment,&amp;quot; another source said. The HZL case is stuck in the Supreme Court after the National Confederation of Officers' Associations of Central Public Sector Undertakings filed a PIL challenging the proposed disinvestment, saying the decision is &amp;quot;irrational, illogical, illegal, unreasonable, mala fide and arbitrary&amp;quot;. The Association sought a direction to restrain the Centre from going ahead with disinvestment till the case is pending. CBI had earlier informed the apex court that the agency had registered a preliminary enquiry into the sale of a part of the government's share in the PSU to Vedanta's subsidiary in 2002-03. In January 2012, Vedanta had proposed to acquire the government's remaining stake in the two erstwhile PSUs for about Rs 17,275 crore. Last October, the shareholders gave their nod to raise offers for acquiring the remaining government stake in HZL and Balco by up to 43 percent or up to Rs 24,663 crore. After shareholders' approval, Vedanta Board is now empowered to make an offer of up to Rs 21,636.56 crore for the remaining government stake in HZL. For Balco, the offer can be up to Rs 3,026.14 crore.","Balco, Business, CBI, Coal India, disinvestment, Hindustan Zinc, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, PTI, Supreme Court","PTI,Hindustan Zinc,Balco,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Coal India,disinvestment,CBI,Supreme Court",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/residual-stake-salehzl-balco-unlikely-this-fiscal_1254931.html

The country's largest oil and gas explorer said it had initiated field development at its block in the Krishna-Godavari basin, which it plans to develop in four clusters. ONGC, which has struggled to maintain production from its ageing wells off the west coast, is counting on the potentially large reserves of oil and gas from the KG-D5 block to boost future profits. Estimated reserves for the block are 121 million metric tonnes of oil in place and 78.8 billion cubic metres (bcm) of initial gas in place for the northern discovery area and 80.8 bcm for the southern discovery area, ONGC said in a statement. The company won the block in a government auction in the year 2000 and has been hurt by delays in reaching production. The company's D5 Block (KG-D5) in the Bay of Bengal sits adjacent to Reliance Industries Ltd's producing D6 block, and ONGC has accused Reliance of drawing gas from fields owned by it.","Business, KG-D5 block, Krishna Godavari, natural gas, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,natural gas,Krishna-Godavari ,KG-D5 block",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-targets-gas-production-by-mid-2018east-coast_1247562.html

According to a new subsidy sharing formula, the payout of upstream oil producers like ONGC is to be reduced to the extent of Rs 4,500 per tonne oil development cess they pay to the government, sources privy to the development said. The move to lessen the subsidy burden will give a flip to government's plan to sell 5 percent stake in Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) to garner about Rs 17,000 crore. The cess in current fiscal will total Rs 10,500 crore and after accounting for Rs 31,926 crore that upstream firms ONGC and&amp;amp;nbsp;Oil India (OIL) have already paid in fuel subsidy in first half, their payout in remainder of the current fiscal will be no more than Rs 8,000 crore. Upstream producers like Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) met nearly half of the revenue loss or under-recoveries that fuel retailers incurred on selling cooking fuel and diesel until recently at government controlled rates. This dole, which was in the form of deep discounts on oil ONGC sold to refineries, had strained its balance sheet as its net realisation fell below the economic cost of oil. Sources said subsidy burden on upstream oil companies has increased from Rs 32,000 crore or 30 percent of the total under-recovery in 2008-09 to Rs 67,021 crore (48 percent of the total under-recovery) in 2013-14. In 2013-14, ONGC paid a record Rs 56,384 crore subsidy, which this fiscal is likely to come down to around Rs 32,000 crore. This has significantly constrained the capacity of these companies to increase their exploration efforts in difficult areas, thereby adversely affecting the country's domestic oil production. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) had in its report on Pricing Mechanism earlier this year stated that the combined effect of cess and discount had resulted in margin per barrel of crude from nomination blocks of ONGC being much lower than private sector fields. The report had also pointed out that the uncertainty in the mechanism of funding under-recoveries would place public sector upstream companies at a relatively disadvantageous position. Sources said the ministry wants the cess being collected by the government from the nominated fields of the public sector upstream oil companies be considered part of the subsidy burden share borne by ONGC and Oil India Ltd (OIL). Thus the upstream share would reduce to the extent of cess being paid by them to the government.","Business, CAG, Comptroller and Auditor General of India, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Oil India, oil ministry, ONGC, subsidy burden","Oil Ministry,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,ONGC,Oil India,subsidy burden,Comptroller and Auditor General of India,CAG",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/oil-min-to-cut-subsidy-burdenongc-adjust-cess-payment_1247212.html

2014-12-04T10:08:02+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,"Ambareesh Baliga is bullish on L&amp;amp;T, Pidilite, Infosys","Amongst the midcaps, Ambareesh Baliga is very bullish on Pidilite Industries.","Independent market expert, Ambareesh Baliga is of the view that momentum is still driving stocks and despite them seeing a run up, money is chasing momentum. He expects to see more money going into these momentum stocks. &amp;quot;Market has its own mind&amp;quot;, says Baliga.He is very bullish on&amp;amp;nbsp;Larsen and Toubro because of its under performance so far and says one can look at buying it at current levels.According to him&amp;amp;nbsp;Infosys could still be bought at Rs 2080 for a target price of Rs 2200.Amongst the midcaps, he is very bullish on&amp;amp;nbsp;Pidilite Industries and expects and EPS of Rs 14.50 for FY16. He sees margin expansion for the company because of low raw material prices and says they have the ability to increase prices in case the raw material prices go up. Although he still likes&amp;amp;nbsp;Bharat Forge and&amp;amp;nbsp;Motherson Sumi he does not advice buying fresh into them because they seem to be fully priced at this juncture. However, one can surely hold on to them with a stop loss, he adds. Similarly, he would not buy&amp;amp;nbsp;TVS Motor fresh at current levels.From the divestment bucket, he prefers&amp;amp;nbsp;ONGC and Coal India. Following is the transcript of his stock ideas On&amp;amp;nbsp;NBCCThere is momentum and despite this sort of gains,&amp;amp;nbsp; we have seen that money has been chasing momentum. So, because of this news again you will have more money flowing into it and it can still move up further.On L&amp;amp;amp;TMy picks have been stocks like Larsen &amp;amp;amp; Toubro (L&amp;amp;amp;T) even in the past and I continue suggesting that because again if you notice it&amp;amp;rsquo;s been a bit of an underperformer. In the same segment Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) which was a very bad underperformer in the last four months, has caught up from Rs 220 it is moved up but this stock hasn&amp;amp;rsquo;t really moved up in tandem so at these levels one could look at picking it up. &amp;amp;nbsp;On Bharat ForgeI was bullish on both Motherson Sumi and Bharat Forge both have been multibaggers. However at these levels I am fining it very difficult to suggest fresh buying based on fundamental because it is more than fully priced. However momentum is driving it, you just hold on with a stop loss.On OFS stocksYou really can not trade on the positive side till the Offer for Sale (OFS) is through because these happen at a slight discount and till that happens you have a bit of a pressure on these stocks. However once it is done in OFS possibly I would look at buying Coal India and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) because these are the one where I see a descent move possibly over the next one and a half two years.On TVS MotorI would not back these stocks at these levels. We have seen that move up from Rs 30-40 levels to the current levels. It is more than fully priced. It can still move up more but, fresh investment buy at this point of time possible not. Although I had a contrarian bet on Bajaj Auto even that has moved up from the levels which I had recommended. I had recommended at Rs 2,100 levels from there it as moved up but then whatever said and done you have that negative news so even Bajaj Auto at this juncture I will not buy fresh.Disclosure: &amp;quot;Among the stocks recommended, I have Pidilite and would hold on till it reaches Rs 560-580, says Baliga","Ambareesh Baliga, Bharat Forge, Coal India, Infosys, Larsen and Toubro, Motherson Sumi Systems, National Buildings Construction Corporation, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Pidilite Industries, Stocks Views, TVS Motor Company","Ambareesh Baliga,Larsen and Toubro,Infosys,Pidilite Industries,Bharat Forge,Motherson Sumi Systems,TVS Motor Company,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Coal India",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/stocks-views/ambareesh-baliga-is-bullishlt-pidilite-infosys_1244441.html

Pradhan did not give details in a written statement while responding to a lawmaker's query. The country's largest oil and gas explorer, nearly 69 percent owned by the government, has seen profits decline due to the sale of crude oil to state-run refiners at discounted rates. India does not regulate prices of petrol and diesel any longer, but state-owned companies are forced to discount prices of other common fuels such as kerosene and cooking gas to keep a lid on retail prices. Any move to lessen its discount burden will be favoured by investors as the government plans to sell a 5 percent stake, worth about USD 2.5 billion, in ONGC as part of its divestment programme. Shares in ONGC ended 3 percent higher at 371.45 rupees, while the broader Nifty rose 0.15 percent.","Business, Cooking gas, Dharmendra Pradhan, kerosene, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation","Business, Cooking gas, Dharmendra Pradhan, kerosene, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/govt-may-revise-ongcs-subsidy-sharing-structure-oilmin_1243923.html

ONGC is using cluster approach to bring oil and gas finds in the block KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5, which sits next to Reliance Industries' Bay of Bengal block KG-D6, to production by 2018-19, he told Lok Sabha in a written reply to a question. &amp;quot;The block (KG-D5) is divided into the Northern Discovery Area (NDA) and Southern Discovery Area (SDA). Estimated reserves of NDA are 121 million tons of oil inplace and 78 billion cubic meter of initial gas in place and that of SDA are 80.9 bcm of intial gas in place,&amp;quot; he said. ONGC plans to develop the discoveries in the block in three clusters - 14.5 million standard cubic meters per day of gas for 15 years from Cluster-1 comprising of D&amp;amp;amp;E finds of NDA in KG-D5 block and G-4 find in the a neighbouring area. Cluster-2A mainly comprises of oil finds in NDA. &amp;quot;It is envisaged to drill 14 oil wells and 10 water injectors in this cluster and is expected to produce approx. 31.5 million tonne of oil in 15 years with peak production rate of 91,000 barrels of oil per day,&amp;quot; he said. Cluster 2B, which is made up of four gas finds in NDA, envisages to produce peak production rate of 12.5 mmscmd, with cumulative production of 32.5 bcm of gas in 14 years. &amp;quot;Efforts to achieve first gas by mid-2018 and first oil by mid-2019 from above clusters are ongoing. Parallel execution of number of project activities are in progress to ensure fast track development of these fields,&amp;quot; he said. Pradhan said exercise to identify associated risks and appropriate mitigation measures are also being planned. Cluster-3 is the UD-1 gas discovery in SDA. &amp;quot;Considering the water depth (2400-3200 meters) and the constrained techno-economic solutions, execution of this Cluster-3 is presently not being pursued for development. Scouting for suitable technology/solution for field development is in progress,&amp;quot; he said.

ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), and&amp;amp;nbsp;Oil India Ltd (OIL) have already spent USD 5 billion in taking 20 percent stake in Area-1 gas field. Their share of investment for developing the offshore gas field and converting the fuel into LNG for export in ships would be another USD 3 billion-plus. Though the required law and investment agreements are in place for the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) for the upstream component, the special regimes required for midstream and downstream investment (pipelines and LNG plants) are yet to be finalised, sources privy to the development said. The special regimes for midstream and downstream investment require passing of a decree law and an LNG investment agreement with the approval of the Parliament of Mozambique. While the Mozambique cabinet has approved the decree law, it is awaiting Parliament nod, sources said. Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan today pressed visting Mozambique Foreign Minister Oldemiro Julio Marques Baloi for early passage of the law. Any delay in the Parliament nod will push back the project as Mozambique is headed for general elections and a new Parliament may take sometime to constitute and approve the decree. This, they said, may result in erosion in the value of project. Sources said OVL and partners are targeting 2019 for start of gas production. An official statement said Pradhan and the visiting minister discussed various areas of mutual cooperation in the energy sector. &amp;quot;Pradhan said that both the countries have traditional links which have grown from strength to strength over the years,&amp;quot; it said. During the meeting, an MoU was signed between India and Mozambique on cooperation in the field of oil and gas for five years. &amp;quot;The objective of the MoU is to enhance bilateral cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit,&amp;quot; the statement said.

ONGC will drill over 350 wells in three blocks in Jharia, Bokaro and North Karanpur in Jharkhand. A fourth block in Ranigajan North in West Bengal may be relinquished as it may fall in way of a planned air-strip. &amp;quot;Production will start in three years and peak output of 3.2 mmscmd is likely in 2020-21,&amp;quot; he said. On pricing, he said CBM production is viable at USD 4.8 per million British thermal unit gas price. In comparison, the current government mandated rate is USD 4.24. ONGC sells CBM gas from wells at Parbatpur in the Jharia block at an approved price of USD 5.1 per mmBtu. Mahawar said the company board has approved an investment of Rs 1,200 crore in the Bokaro block to produce a peak gas of 0.7 mmscmd. In all, 160 wells are to be drilled on Bokaro block, of which 9 have already been drilled, he said. ONGC is the operator of Bokaro as well as North Karanpur blocks with 80 per cent interest. Indian Oil Corp (IOC) holds the remaining 20 per cent. It is the operator of the Raniganj North block with a 74 percent stake and Coal India Ltd holds the rest. In Jharia, ONGC holds 90 percent and Coal India the remaining 10 per cent. The Jharia block is estimated to hold 85 billion cubic metres of gas reserves, North Karanpura 62 billion cubic metres, Bokaro 45 billion cubic metres and Raniganj North 43 billion cubic metres.

Pradhan said the endeavour is to bring a comprehensive and holistic policy that will help boost CBM production. Private firms like Essar Oil say pricing is inadequate and public sector companies like ONGC too in muted voices say the same thing, he said. &amp;quot;The policy will be brought after stakeholder consultations,&amp;quot; he said adding the operators will have to assure that they will increase production as well as bring in technology.He however did not give details of the policy nor a timeframe for bringing it. &amp;quot;Affordability of consumers will have to be kept in mind while framing such a policy,&amp;quot; he said. The Government has so far awarded 33 CBM blocks in four rounds of auctions. Of these, 13 blocks have either been relinquished or offered to be relinquished due to poor CBM prospectivity.Great Eastern Energy Co Ltd (GEECL) has begun production&amp;amp;nbsp; from Raniganj (South) block in West Bengal and is currently producing about 1 million standard cubic metres per day, while state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has entered the development phase in four blocks, including Raniganj (North). Reliance Industries (RIL) has entered the development phase in its Sohagpur East and West CBM blocks in Madhya Pradesh, while Essar Oil has done the same in case of RG(E)-CBM-2001/1 block in West Bengal.Tripathi said the problems faced by CBM operators including land acquisition and overlapping of CBM resource with coal reserves.Pradhan said unlike past when different arms of the government acted at cross-purpose, the present regime has started to sort out overlapping and other issues.

India, the world's fourth-biggest oil consumer, has to ship in three quarters of its oil needs and with oil prices close to their lowest since the global financial crisis has added incentive to seal purchases to limit import reliance. The deal, which could be worth around USD 1 billion based on the valuation of a recent stake purchase, is expected to take final shape during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Moscow next week for summit talks with President Vladimir Putin, said the sources with direct knowledge of the situation. Rosneft, the world's biggest listed oil company by output, also stands to benefit as it has been scouting for partners as Western sanctions tied to Russia's annexation of Crimea have limited its access to global funds and technology. Officials at the two state-run Indian firms are in Moscow to negotiate with Rosneft for up to a 29 percent stake in Rosneft's Taas-Yuriakh, the sources said, adding that the exact size and value of the stake was yet to be decided. The sources declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. Taas-Yuriakh, which operates the Srednebotuobinsk field, is expected to produce more than 5 million tonnes of oil annually from 2017. Rosneft last month sold a 20 percent share in Taas-Yuriakh to BP for USD 750 million, and based on that valuation a 29 percent stake could be worth around USD 1 billion. Rosneft said on Nov. 30 it planned to select a second partner in Taas-Yuriakh. Business development directors at the two Indian companies and Rosneft declined to comment. If the deal goes through, it would mark India's second acquisition in Russia since Modi took office in May last year and a third under the ruling Bhartiya Janata Party. In 2002, Oil and Natural Gas Corp bought a 20 percent stake in the Sakhalin I field. India has frequently lost out to China in the race to acquire resources overseas in the last decade, but its oil diplomacy has gained momentum under Modi, who has made frequent foreign trips. In September, ONGC Videsh, the overseas investment arm of oil firm ONGC, acquired a 15 percent stake in Russia's Vankor field, a deal that was sealed in July when Modi met Putin at a BRICS summit. N.K. Verma, managing director of ONGC Videsh, said the push by the Modi government meant that &amp;quot;India Inc has now been taken as a dependable partner and a serious player by the global community in the bigger projects&amp;quot;.","BP, BRICS Summit, Business, Indian Oil Corporation, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Oil India, Rosneft","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Indian Oil Corporation,Oil India,Rosneft,BP,BRICS summit",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ioctalks-to-buy-stakesiberia-oil-project-sources_4638481.html

OVL, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), will get 4 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas for the stake in Vankorneft, the developer of the Vankor oil and gas condensate field in Turukhansky district of Krasnoyak Territory in Russia. The deal, the first overseas acquisition by an oil PSU since the NDA regime came to power in May 2014, was approved at the meeting of the Cabinet this evening. Modi was keen to see the deal through which will help India's energy security, sources said. &amp;quot;We were able to get the deal through with the proactive involvement of the government,&amp;quot; OVL Managing Director N K Verma told PTI here. The field has recoverable reserves of 2.5 billion barrels. OVL had in September signed definitive agreements to acquire up to 15 percent shares in CSJC Vankorneft, a company organised under the law of Russian Federation which is the owner of Vankor Field and North Vankor licence. Rosneft, Russia's national oil company, holds 100 percent stake in Vankorneft. The acquisition is subject to relevant board, government and regulatory approvals and is expected to be completed by 2016-mid, sources said. This will be the fourth biggest acquisition by OVL. It had in 2013 paid USD 4.125 billion for a 16 percent stake in Mozambique's offshore Rovuma Area 1, which holds as much as 75 Trillion cubic feet of gas reserves. In 2009, it had bought Russia-focused Imperial Energy for USD 2.1 billion. Prior to that, it had in 2001 paid USD 1.7 billion for a 20 percent interest in the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas field off Russia's far eastern coast. &amp;quot;Vankor is Rosneft's (and Russia's) second largest field by production and accounts for 4 percent of Russian production. The daily production from the field is around 4,42,000 barrels per day of crude oil. Upon completion of the deal, OVL will have two seats on the board of Vankorneft. Rosneft, whose stake in the project will come down to 85 percent, will however keep full control of the general infrastructure of Vankor cluster, including oil pipeline Vankor-Purpe.","Business, Cabinet, government, Narendra Modi, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, oil deal, ONGC Videsh, Rosneft, Russia's Vankor oilfield","Cabinet,ONGC Videsh,Russia's Vankor oilfield,oil deal,Narendra Modi,government,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Rosneft",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/govt-nod-to-ovls-36126-bn-stake-buyvankor-field_4616101.html

Consequently, the well had to be closed and abandoned. As a result, expenditure of Rs 1,577.27 crore incurred by ONGC on drillingof the original location and drilling of a relief well by using another rig proved avoidable.&amp;quot;The insurer did not honour the claim of ONGC on the ground that the latter had not followed recognised safe operating practice,&amp;quot; the report said.Also, the company did not adhere to the repair schedule for dry dock management and major lay-up repairs of jack-up rigs which was against an efficient operational practice.Failure on the part of the company led to a situation wherein rigs were being operated with outdated/obsolete equipment, CAG said.CAG said ONGC had prepared 5-year rig requirement on the basis of RRP, which included non-operational idling time of rigs that was entirely controllable by the company.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Annual Rig Deployment Plans (RDPs) were prepared on the basis of RRP. &amp;quot;Therefore, the Annual Rig Deployment Plans had an in-built inefficiency,&amp;quot; it said.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; While there was no uniformity in preparation of annual RDPs among the Assets and Basins of ONGC, the company failed to decide a policy on acquisition of new offshore rigs for over a decade -- from 2002 to 2015.Meanwhile, four out of six owned offshore rigs outlived their economic usable life of thirty years. CAG asked ONGC to ensure that the plans (five year plan,annual plan, rig requirement plan, rig deployment plan) are complete and consistent with each other and are complied with.The situation where one out of every three wells drilled is un-planned needs to be corrected, it said, adding that the controllable non-productive time of past periods should not be loaded to future rig requirement plans and efforts to be taken to reduce such non-productive time.","Business, CAG, Comptroller and Auditor General of India, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Parliament","Comptroller and Auditor General of India,CAG,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Parliament",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cag-raps-ongc-for-rs-8k-cr-loss-due-to-poor-rig-management_4518681.html

OVL, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), has proposed to build one LNG train of 6 million tonnes a year","ONGC Videsh Ltd-led consortium is close to winning USD 5 billion rights to develop Iran's Farzad-B gas field and convert the gas produced from it into LNG for shipping to countries like India. &amp;quot;The first development phase of Farzad-B is expected to require USD 3 billion in investment,&amp;quot; Saeed Hafezi, managing director of the Iranian Offshore Oil Company, was quoted as saying by Mehr News Agency of Iran. The gas produced from the field will be converted into liquefied natural gas (LNG) for export to consuming nations like India. OVL, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), has proposed to build one LNG train of 6 million tonnes a year. A consortium of OVL, Oil India Ltd (OIL) and Indian Oil Corp (IOC) had discovered the 12.8 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves in the Farsi block in 2008. The discovery was named Farzad-B. But the Indians firms were forced to put the project on backburner after the US and the EU introduced tough sanctions against the Persian Gulf country. However, the agreement between Iran and six world powers last July has cleared the way for an easing of sanctions. Hafezi said a new round of negotiations is underway with Indian contractors on marketing or delivering Farzad-B natural gas to India. Gas output from the field can either be converted into LNG and shipped to India or transported through a pipeline via Pakistan or subsea. &amp;quot;We can close a deal with Indians if the two sides agree on a contractual model and the method of gas supply or marketing,&amp;quot; Hafezi added. While the field development may cost USD 3 billion, another USD 2 billion would be required for setting up LNG plant. OVL Managing Director Narendra K Verma said the company has not heard anything from Iran. &amp;quot;I have not seen any paper from Iran granting us the development rights. We have to wait for that,&amp;quot; he said. Earlier this year, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh described Farzad-B as the only Iranian project &amp;quot;promised&amp;quot; to a foreign contractor. As a further sign of interest in working with Indians in Farzad-B project, Iran did not list the gas field among the 52 oil and natural gas projects introduced to international companies in a major conference in Tehran last month. OVL in August/September 2010 submitted a revised master development plan (MDP) for producing 60 per cent of the 21.68 trillion cubic feet of in-place gas reserves but had not signed the contract because of threat of being sanctioned by the US which is against any company investing more than USD 20 million in Iran's energy sector in any 12-month period. OVL and IOC hold 40 percent interest each in the block, while the remaining 20 percent is with OIL.","Business, Farzad-B gas field, gas, India, Indian Oil Corporation, Iran, LNG, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Oil India, ONGC Videsh Ltd, Saeed Hafezi","ONGC Videsh Ltd,Farzad-B gas field,Iran,gas,LNG,India,Saeed Hafezi,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Oil India,Indian Oil Corporation",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ovl-close-to-winning-365-bn-farzab-b-gas-field-rights_4496321.html

ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) hopes to capitalise on cheaper assets after a slump in oil prices and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's diplomatic efforts to boost the global presence of Indian firms. &amp;quot;Earlier it was an asset-based (strategy) but now we are giving good consideration to M&amp;amp;amp;A,&amp;quot; Narendra K Verma, managing director of OVL, told the Reuters Global Commodities Summit. &amp;quot;Our mandate is huge and we can acquire a larger portfolio through the corporate acquisition route,&amp;quot; added Verma, who has overseen USD 7 billion in deals over four years. OVL, which produces about 175,000-180,000 barrels per day (bpd) from its overseas assets, wants to double output by 2018 and increase it six-fold by 2030. The firm has stakes in 33 oil and gas projects from Venezuela to South Sudan but its first corporate investment in 2008, buying Russia's Imperial Energy for USD 2.6 billion, did not turn out as planned with output slumping to 8,000 bpd from an estimated 60,000 bpd. Still, Verma said the firm was not put off and was &amp;quot;working on some opportunities where we could see a broader portfolio being available to us.&amp;quot; HOTSPOTS OVL last month concluded a deal to buy a 15 percent stake in Rosneft's Vankor field to secure access to about 66,000 bpd of oil production at the Siberian field. But Verma said Africa and Latin America were likely to be the hotspots for new investment with some companies financially stressed due to high capital expenditure and low oil prices. OVL is also better placed than some of its global peers to invest due to the financial strength of its parent, state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC). The firm was in talks with overseas partners to reformulate exploration and development expenditure as current revenue at oil firms had halved due to weaker oil prices, he said. OVL also hoped to wrap up talks in two months to refinance USD 1.7 billion in loans at LIBOR plus 120 basis points maturing in 2021, versus the current LIBOR plus 195 basis points running to 2020, he said. ONGC and its Indian partners have submitted a USD 5-billion revised plan to Iran seeking development rights of Farzad B gas field, Verma said. The revised contract offered more flexibility and included a mix of production sharing and service contracts, he said, adding investment could double if infrastructure is built to supply gas to New Delhi.","Business, LIBOR plus, Narendra Modi, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, ONGC Videsh Ltd, Prime Minister, Reuters Global Commodities Summit","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,ONGC Videsh Ltd,Narendra Modi,Prime Minister,Reuters Global Commodities Summit,LIBOR plus",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-targets-3610-3612-bn-foreign-oilgas-investments_3691561.html

A full chapter on resolution of such a dispute through unit development has been devoted in the PSC.&amp;quot;As per the terms of the contract, if a reservoir is situated partly within a contract area belonging to a party and partly in a different contract area, any of the parties could write to the government, and the government then will ask the two contractors to collaborate and agree on a joint development of reservoir within a stipulated time period.&amp;quot;If parties fail to agree to do so, the government can force the parties to prepare and execute such a joint plan,&amp;quot; it said.RIL began gas production from KG-D6 block in April 2009 while ONGC is yet to begin development work on gas fields in G-4 that were discovered more than 12 years back.&amp;quot;PSC does not provide for an explicit retrospective penalty on any of the parties that produced from its approved contract area (mining lease area) as per an approved field development plan, if the other party to the dispute failed to seek such a unit development,&amp;quot; HSBC said.ONGC had sought compensation for the gas belonging to it that RIL had produced.Sources said D&amp;amp;amp;M has in its preliminary comments stated that the reservoir in the two neighbouring blocks are connected and there is no unconnected area in G-4.ONGC claims that 11.9 billion cubic meters (bcm) of its gas may have been produced from RIL's KG-D6 field. This at a gas price of USD 4.2 per mmBtu, will be worth less than USD 180 million.Even this it can get only after field expenses as well as taxes and royalty paid by RIL is deducted, they said.D&amp;amp;amp;M is likely to submit its report on the issue by next month. And as per Supreme Court order the Oil Ministry will have six months from the date the report is submitted to decide if ONGC is entitled to any compensation from RIL.","Bay of Bengal, Business, DeGolyer and MacNaughton, Godavari Block, HSBC Global Research, KG-D6, Krishna-Godavari basin, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, production sharing contract, PTI, Reliance Industries","PTI,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Bay of Bengal,KG-D6,Reliance Industries,Krishna Godavari basin,Godavari Block,DeGolyer and MacNaughton,HSBC Global Research,production sharing contract",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-may-not-get-much-compensationgas-disputeril_3532521.html

2015-10-01T14:42:44+05:30,ONGC,Devika Ghosh,"Gas price cut: CNG,cooking gas prices may fall, says Ind-Ra","The domestic gas price cut will make CNG 44-45% more competitive than diesel, compared with 39% currently, while PNG would become 1-2% more competitive than subsidised LPG, compared with a negative 8% currently","With the government reducing domestic gas prices by 18 percent to USD 3.82/mmbtu &amp;amp;mdash; applicable from October 1, 2015, to March 31, 2016 &amp;amp;mdash; end consumers have much to rejoice. India Ratings expects compressed natural gas (CNG) and piped natural gas (PNG domestic) prices to be revised downward. It further expects a Rs 2.1-2.3/scm cut in PNG prices and Rs 2.8-3.0/kg reduction in CNG prices. This will make CNG 44-45 percent more competitive than diesel, compared with 39 percent currently, while PNG would become 1-2 percent more competitive than subsidised LPG, compared with a negative 8 percent currently, the ratings agency states. Over April-September 2015, diesel price declined by 8 percent, while that of CNG remained unchanged, thus lowering the fuel competitiveness of CNG. This is the second domestic gas price reduction and is driven by the decline in average gas prices prevalent at the reference hubs over the period July 2014-June 2015, the report states. The first downward price revision was to USD 4.66/mmbtu (million British thermal unit) from USD 5.05/mmbtu on April 1, 2015. The average Henry Hub gas prices declined to USD 3.33/mmbtu from USD 4.35/mmbtu over January-December 2014. The government announced on Wednesday that natural gas prices, according to a formula approved by the government in October last year, will fall to USD 4.24 per million British thermal unit on net calorific value (NCV) basis from the current USD 5.50 per mmBtu. On gross calorific value (GCV) basis, the new gas price for October 1 to March 31 would be USD 3.82 per mmBtu as compared to USD 4.66 currently, officials said. However, India Ratings says the benefit from reduced gas price will be partly offset by the near 6 percent rupee depreciation over April-September 2015. Thus, the net impact of the reduced domestic gas prices in rupee terms would be nearly 11-16 percent. The steepest ever reduction will, however, hit producers like state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India as well as central government whose earnings from royalty and income tax will dip by about Rs 800 crore during the remainder of the fiscal, according to industry estimates. The ratings agency says Oil India and ONGC may face a revenue decline of Rs 120-130 crore and Rs 1080-1150 crore, respectively, on gas sales during the second half of FY16. In the mid-stream segment, Gail (India) may see Rs 1790-1900 crore lower trading revenue from the sale of domestic gases during 2HFY16. But for corporates such as Zuari Agro and Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers (RCF), the reduction in prices comes as a boon as it will result in reduction of input prices. RG Rajan, Chairman and Managing Director of state-owned Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers, told CNBC-TV18 that the reduction in gas prices will help the company save roughly Rs 70 crore every month on gas costs. Kapil Mehan, MD &amp;amp;amp; Group CEO, Zuari Agro too says the price cut will help reduce input costs by roughly Rs 1000 per tonne.","Business, central government, CNG, compressed natural gas, diesel, GAIL India, gas, Income Tax, India Ratings, LPG, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Oil India, piped natural gas, PNG, Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers, RG Rajan, royalty, Rupee, Zuari Agro Chemicals","gas,India Ratings,compressed natural gas,CNG,piped natural gas,PNG,diesel,LPG,rupee,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Oil India,income tax,royalty,central government,GAIL India,Zuari Agro Chemicals,Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers,RG Rajan",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/gas-price-cut-cngcooking-gas-prices-may-fall-says-ind-ra_3368561.html

2015-09-21T14:29:38+05:30,ONGC,Faizan Javed,"ONGC, OIL, Cairn India ask govt to cut cess on crude","The producers want the government to levy ad-valorem rate of cess which will result in higher payouts when prices are high and lower payout when rates fall. Currently, ONGC and OIL pay a cess of Rs 4,500 per ton on crude oil they produce from fields given to them on nomination basis.","State-owned oil producers ONGC and Oil India as well as private sector Cairn India have asked the government to cut cess on crude oil they have to pay in view of slump in prices. The producers want the government to levy ad-valorem rate of cess which will result in higher payouts when prices are high and lower payout when rates fall. Currently, ONGC and OIL pay a cess of Rs 4,500 per ton on crude oil they produce from fields given to them on nomination basis. Cairn has to pay the same cess for oil from Rajasthan block. Their association, PetroFed last week wrote to Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia and Oil Secretary KD Tripathi seeking levy of 8 percent cess on price of crude oil realised. The Oil Industry (Development) Act, 1974 provides for collection of cess as a duty of excise on indigenous crude oil. Cess incurred by producers is not recoverable from refineries and thus forms part of cost of production of crude oil. The cess was levied at Rs 60 per tone in July 1974 and subsequently revised from time to time. &amp;quot;During 2005-06, when the crude oil prices had increased from an average of USD 40 per barrel to USD 60 per barrel, OID Cess was increased from Rs 1,800 to Rs 2,500 per ton from March 1, 2006. &amp;quot;Again, when the crude oil prices increased to over USD 100 per barrel, the rate of cess was increased by Government to Rs 4,500 per ton (USD 10 per barrel) with effect from March 17, 2012,&amp;quot; PetroFed wrote. It said the government had effectively linked the cess rate to prevailing crude oil prices in the past. &amp;quot;The crude oil prices have not been for sometime around USD 40 to 50 per barrel while the cess continues at the same rate as prevailing when crude oil was around USD 100 per barrel. In a low crude oil price regime, cess imposes a significant economic burden on producers,&amp;quot; it said. The producers said the current cess rate constitutes about 20 percent of the oil price, which has severely impacted several small discoveries and marginal fields making many of the projects unviable. In the low oil price environment several countries including UK, US, Colombia, Russia and China have changed fiscal systems to increase production and promote investments. &amp;quot;It is, therefore, submitted that there is an urgent need to reduce the rate of cess in parity with prevailing crude oil prices. Keeping in view the volatility in crude prices, it would be prudent that OID Cess may be levied at ad-valorem basis linking it to the realised crude oil prices which would be about 8 percent of the same,&amp;quot; PetroFed said. This, it said, would provide some predictability to oil producers and would also be in line with the historically followed policy by the government. Most of crude oil produced in India comes from pre-NELP and nomination blocks and is liable for payment of cess.While New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) blocks like Reliance Industries' KG-D6 area are exempt from payment of cess, pre-NELP discovered blocks like Panna/Mukta and Tapti and Ravva pay a fixed rate of cess of Rs 900 per ton.","Business, Cairn India, China, Colombia, Crude oil, crude oil prices, fiscal systems, government, Hasmukh Adhia, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Oil India, Oil Secretary, PetroFed, Reliance Industries, Revenue Secretary, United Kingdom, United States","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Oil India,Cairn India, government,crude oil,crude oil prices,PetroFed,Reliance Industries,Colombia,United Kingdom,China,United States,Hasmukh Adhia,Oil Secretary,Revenue Secretary,fiscal systems",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-oil-cairn-india-ask-govt-to-cut-cesscrude_3171241.html

2015-09-15T14:38:43+05:30,ONGC,Faizan Javed,ONGC bucks trend to build assets as oil prices ease,"Oil majors including Shell, Total and BP have cut capital spending by at least USD 14 billion this year in response to the plummeting oil price.","Global oil majors have slashed spending and cut jobs in response to plunging oil prices but state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is using the slump to build assets. Oil majors including Shell, Total and BP have cut capital spending by at least USD 14 billion this year in response to the plummeting oil price. Addressing company shareholders, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Dinesh K Sarraf said energy industry, particularly the oil and gas sector, was facing challenging times due to the collapse of crude prices. Oil prices, he said, have collapsed from USD 110 per barrel to sub-50 dollars a barrel due to lower growth in demand than expected from China, slow recovery in some of the developed economies and steady build-up of new supplies backed by strong North American output. &amp;quot;While many of the global E&amp;amp;amp;P companies have responded to this situation by cutting down their investments, ONGC takes this as an opportunity to build its assets in this environment of lower costs as well,&amp;quot; he said. ONGC, he said, remains &amp;quot;steadfastly committed to the quest of energy security, a national priority endorsed by none other than our Prime Minister.&amp;quot; Sarraf said ONGC has stepped up ongoing development efforts to bring new hydrocarbon volumes into the country's energy basket. &amp;quot;Important projects have been given the go-ahead for development and more proposals to monetise our reserves are under various stages of finally being approved.&amp;quot; Having reversed the decline in crude oil production in 2014-15, ONGC is now fully focused on implementing programmes to raise output from ageing and old fields. &amp;quot;Every drop counts and ONGC's production track record from its predominantly mature portfolio and commercially prudent and holistic management of producing assets is really remarkable,&amp;quot; he said. Improved Oil Recovery and Enhanced Oil Recovery projects to maximise production have yielded positive outcomes - in 2014-15 over 34 percent of ONGC's crude production was a result of investments in these projects, he said. &amp;quot;In fact, effective and judicious deployment of technological interventions have enabled your company to reverse the decline in domestic crude oil production in the last financial year,&amp;quot; he told shareholders. Overall decline rate of ONGC's mature portfolio is 2 to 3 percent compared to 6 to 7 percent encountered globally in similar fields. Sarraf said ONGC has invested Rs 36,187 crore in these projects and realised an incremental oil gain of close to 95 million tons till FY'15. The dollar value of the incremental production from these projects in FY'15 alone stood at USD 4.5 billion - around 4 percent of country's forex outgo on imports.","Business, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, PTI","PTI,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-bucks-trend-to-build-assets-as-oil-prices-ease_3083901.html

OVL had raised Euro 525 million (about USD 712 million) through a 7-year bond issue in July last year to part finance its USD 4.125 billion purchase of a 16 percent stake in Mozambique's offshore Rovuma Area 1, which holds as much as 75 Trillion cubic feet of gas reserves. &amp;quot;The decision to go for a Euro bond issue has paid dividends. We have made a gain of about Rs 700 crore on account of foreign exchange changes. When we raised the loan, one Euro was equivalent to USD 1.36. Today the ratio is 1.12:1,&amp;quot; OVL Director (Finance) S P Garg said here. The exchange rate change means OVL will have to repay Rs 700 crore less as its revenues are mostly dollarised. The loan was raised at a highly competitive interest rate of 2.75 percent per annum and the exchange rate changes have meant that OVL is saving Rs 50 crore in interest outgo per annum, he said. Alongside the Euro 525 million raised through a 7-year bonds issue, OVL had also raised USD 750 million by selling dollar denominated bonds of 5-year tenure and another USD 750 million selling 10-year bonds. Garg said the bond sale was the biggest ever from Asia. Also, it was the first euro issue for a government-owned corporate. The 5-year and 10-year dollar bonds were priced at 160 basis points and 207 basis points above the 5-year and 10-year US treasury yields. A basis point is 0.01 percent. Garg said OVL decided to fund the Mozambique acquisition through cheapest available loan. The effective rate of interest was 3.25 percent for the 5-year dollar bond and 4.622 percent for the 10-year dollar bond. He said the bond proceeds were used to refinance OVL's bridge loans availed to immediately pay for the Mozambique acquisition. In June 2013, OVL teamed up with Oil India Ltd to buy Videocon Industries' 10 percent stake in deep water gas field in Mozambique's Rovuma basin for USD 2.48 billion.  OVL followed it up by acquiring another 10 percent stake from Anadarko Petroleum Corp of the US for USD 2.64 billion in August 2013. The Videocon stake was split between OVL and OIL in 60:40 ratio. To finance its six percent buy, OVL in January 2014 raised USD 1.5 billion one-year bridge loan facility from a consortium of 9 banks. To pay for the Anadarko stake acquisition, it had in February 2014 raised USD 2.5 billion in foreign loans.

2015-08-27T18:35:14+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,ONGC gets one-year extension for Vietnam block,"ONGC, in May, had applied to the Vietnamese authorities for a third extension of the exploration licence for deepsea Block 128 to maintain India's strategic interest in the South China Sea.","State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) on Thursday said it has received a one-year extension to explore in a Vietnam oil block in the contested waters of the South China Sea. It had in May applied to the Vietnamese authorities for a third extension of the exploration licence for deepsea Block 128 to maintain India's strategic interest in the South China Sea. In a regulatory filing, ONGC said its overseas investment arm, ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) had applied for extension of block to PetroVietnam, Vietnam's national oil company, on May 28, 2015. &amp;quot;In response of ONGC Videsh request, PetroVietnam has granted extension of the block up to June 15, 2016,&amp;quot; it said. OVL had signed Production Sharing Contract (PSC) for the 7,058 square kilometer Block 128 in offshore PhuKhanh Basin, Vietnam on May 24, 2006. Ministry of Planning &amp;amp;amp; Investment (MPI), Vietnam issued investment licence for the Block on June 16, 2006, being effective date of the PSC, ONGC said. The company has not found any hydrocarbon in the block but is continuing to stay invested. ONGC termed the extension as &amp;quot;routine&amp;quot; saying such an exercise is carried out in all the exploration blocks where extensions are required for further studies. OVL first took a two-year extension of the exploration period till June 2014 and then another one year. That extended licence expired on June 15, 2015. The company has so far invested USD 50.88 million in the block. The block lies in the part of South China Sea over which China claims sovereignty. In 2011, Beijing had warned OVL that its exploration activities off the Vietnam coast were illegal and violated China's sovereignty, but the company continued exploring for oil and gas. OVL forayed into Vietnam as early as 1988, when it bagged the exploration licence for Block 06.1. The company got two exploration blocks - Block 127 and Block 128, in 2006.

ONGC board earlier this month approved submission of the draft FDP for one set of oil and gas discoveries made in the eastern offshore Block KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5, which sits next to Reliance Industries' flagging KG-D6 area. &amp;quot;We are looking at producing 77,000 barrels per day of oil and 14 million standard cubic meters per day of gas from the first set of discoveries by 2018-19,&amp;quot; a senior company official said.  The 7,294.6 sq km deepsea KG-D5 block has been broadly categorised into Northern Discovery Area (NDA - 3,800.6 sq km) and Southern Discovery Area (SDA - 3,494 sq km). ONGC has divided 12 oil and gas discoveries in KG-D5 and gas discovery in an adjacent G-4 block in the Bay of Bengal into three clusters to quickly bring them to production. Cluster-1 comprises D&amp;amp;amp;E discoveries as also G-4 find in the neighbouring area which ONGC estimates can produce 14.5 mmscmd of gas for 15 years.  Cluster-2A mainly comprises oil finds of A2, P1, M3, M1 and G-2-2 in NDA which can produce 77,000 barrels per day (3.75 million tonnes per annum). Cluster-2B, which is made up of four gas finds -- R1, U3, U1, and A1 in NDA, envisages a peak output of 14 mmscmd of gas with cumulative production of 32.5 bcm of gas in 14 years. The official said ONGC is presently focused on developing Cluster-2A and 2B and a draft FDP for these has been submitted to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH).  &amp;quot;There are some issues regarding conformity tests for discoveries in Cluster-1. So until they are sorted out, a FDP cannot be prepared for them,&amp;quot; he said. The draft FDP for Cluster-2A and 2B does not detail the investment that would be required to bring the discoveries to production, he said.  &amp;quot;There is some more technical work that needs to be done before we arrive at a number but the investment should be in the range of USD 6-7 billion,&amp;quot; he said, adding first gas production is planned by mid-2018 and first oil by mid-2019. If discoveries in Cluster-1 get approved, the total investment will climb to USD 8.843 billion, he said. Cluster-3 is the UD-1 gas discovery in SDA.  &amp;quot;UD-1 lies in water depth of 2,400-3,200 meters and there is no technology to produce from such depths. And so Cluster-3 is presently not being pursued for development,&amp;quot; he said. While gas from the block will be evacuated to Odalarevu onshore terminal in Andhra Pradesh through 20-inch, 35.5 km sub-sea pipeline, oil is proposed to be taken on to an FPSO (Floating Production Storage and Offloading) anchored in high-sea.

2015-08-17T19:24:14+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,Buy ONGC ; target of Rs 342: Edelweiss,"Edelweiss Research is bullish on ONGC and has recommended buy rating on the stock with a target of Rs 342 in its research report dated August 13, 2015.","Edelweiss Research report on ONGC  ONGC reported in line Q1FY16 numbers with PAT at INR54.6bn, up 14% YoY and 39% QoQ. Earnings were driven by a sharp 25% YoY surge in net realisation to USD59/bbl, highest in 4 years, as under-recovery further fell by ~25% during the quarter (down ~85% YoY). Direct benefit transfer (DBTL) on LPG allowed upstream companies to absorb only one-third of the subsidy (54% in Q1FY15). While oil production was flat YoY, gas production dipped 4%. Subsidy scenario now looks comfortable, following diesel deregulation and benign oil prices while DBTL on LPG will significantly reduce upstream contribution. We believe oil prices have bottomed and an expected recovery will translate into significant earnings resurgence for ONGC (10% rise in oil improves earnings 15%). We have revised our FY17 oil price assumption to USD68/bbl (USD72 earlier) and reduced upstream subsidy contribution to 30% (40% earlier), effecting a 9% cut in FY17E EPS. However, after a sharp 20% correction in 3 months, valuations look attractive, discounting USD55/bbl long-term oil price. We, therefore, upgrade to &amp;amp;lsquo;BUY&amp;amp;rsquo; with a revised target price of INR342 (INR367 earlier). Production flat, surge in realisation Crude production from ONGC&amp;amp;rsquo;s nominated blocks was at 5.23MMT (up 1% YoY), while that from JVs fell 4% YoY to 0.91MMT. Gas production, at 5.8bcm, dipped 4% YoY and VAP sales plummeted 8% YoY. While gross realisation declined sharply by 42% YoY, net realisation surged 25%. OVL&amp;amp;rsquo;s total oil &amp;amp;amp; gas production declined 3% YoY. Outlook and valuations: Subsidy comfort; upgrade to &amp;amp;lsquo;BUY&amp;amp;rsquo;Post diesel deregulation, domestic retail reforms continued with implementation of DBTL on LPG, which is likely to reduce under-recovery by INR83bn (refer our note, Good progress on LPG reforms going unnoticed-June 15, 2015). The government has announced further rationalisation of subsidy share (cap kerosene subsidy pay-out at INR12/litre), which will further rationalise upstream&amp;amp;rsquo;s contribution. As oil prices crashed, ONGC stock has taken a toll, falling 30% YoY, and is currently trading at attractive valuations of 9x FY17E PER and at a 30% discount to global peers (Table 3). As the stock is currently pricing in the worst, we upgrade to &amp;amp;lsquo;BUY/SO&amp;amp;rsquo; from &amp;amp;lsquo;HOLD/SP&amp;amp;rsquo; with a target price of INR342.For all recommendations,  click here Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

ONGC's block in the Krishna-Godavari basin should produce 77,000 barrels per day of oil and up to 17 million cubic metres a day of natural gas at peak rate, DK Sarraf told reporters, after ONGC reported a 14 percent jump in quarterly net profit. He added that the investment figures were based on preliminary estimates and that the company had &amp;quot;no plan&amp;quot; currently to bring in a foreign partner for the deepwater development. The company, which has struggled to maintain production from its ageing wells off India's west coast, is counting on the potentially large reserves of oil and gas from the KG-D5 block to boost future profits. ONGC, majority-owned by the government, reported a 14 percent rise in net income to 54.59 billion rupees (USD 839.59 million) in the quarter ended June 30, its fiscal first. The jump was driven by a much lower burden of government-imposed discounts on crude sales to state-run refiners. ONGC's share of the subsidy for the quarter was 11.33 billion rupees, compared with 132 billion a year earlier. India keeps a lid on retail prices of liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene, with upstream companies including ONGC and&amp;amp;nbsp;Oil India offering discounts on crude sales to help cut losses of state refiners. A prolonged period of low crude oil prices coupled with the government's decision last year to deregulate the price of diesel, the country's most widely consumed fuel, has significantly lowered these discounts. That also helped the company improve net realisation, or earnings per barrel of crude, to USD 58.92 from USD 47.15 a barrel a year ago. Net sales for the quarter rose 4.4 percent to 226.96 billion rupees. Shares in ONGC, which has a market valuation of USD 35.59 billion, closed up 0.15 percent on Thursday, largely in line with the broader Mumbai market which closed up 0.14 percent.","Business, energy explorer, gas production, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Oil India, retail prices, Rupee, USD","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Oil India,USD,rupee,gas production,energy explorer,retail prices",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-may-spend-367-bn-to-develop-east-coast-block-dk-sarraf_2514101.html

On the investment pattern, Jalan said, &amp;quot;while 75 percent of the incremental fund will be invested in NSE ETF, the remaining will be made in the BSE ETF. We may also look at investing in the CPSE ETF, whenever it happens.&amp;quot; He also hinted that investment in equities may go up to Rs 7,000-8,000 crore in case some of other organisations like ONGC, whose fund is also managed by the EPFO, decide to invest into equities. Later, financial adviser of EPFO Sanjay Kumar told PTI that, &amp;quot;SBI MF has reduced its fund management charges for EPFO's investment into equities to 7 bps which includes 2 bps for education as levied by Sebi, thus effective fund management charge in our case will be at 5 bps.&amp;quot; SBI MF managing director and chief executive Dinesh Khara said, &amp;quot;it is a very good substitute when compared to FII.  Long-term retirement money coming to equity market will bring stability to the market in the long term.&amp;quot;","Arundhati Bhattacharya, Ashish Kumar Chauhan, BSE chief, Business, Central Provident Fund, chairperson, Chitra Ramkrishna, Dinesh Khara, Financial Adviser, Managing Director, NSE chief, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Sanjay Kumar, SBI MF","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Ashish Kumar Chauhan,SBI MF,Central Provident Fund,Sanjay Kumar,Chitra Ramkrishna,Arundhati Bhattacharya,financial adviser,NSE chief,BSE chief,chairperson,managing director,Dinesh Khara",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/epfo-invests-rs-1-lakh-croreits-over-rs-66-lakh_2378021.html

2015-07-08T12:34:13+05:30,ONGC,Nasrin Sultana,Q1 earnings to be tepid; analysts pick best &amp;amp; worst sectors,"Weak commodity prices, delayed capex recovery and soft rural demand are the key factors that will weigh on June quarter corporate earnings, says CRISIL Research.","Nasrin Sultanamoneycontrol.com Amid growing turmoil in Eurozone and China, Indian equities are readying for what looks to be yet another disappointing earnings season.&amp;amp;nbsp; Weak commodity prices, delayed capex recovery and soft rural demand are the key factors that will weigh on June quarter corporate earnings, says CRISIL Research. Stock prices have been resilient to much of the global bad news over the last few days, but experts caution that lackluster earnings growth could hold back investors from betting big money on India. &amp;quot;Our analysis of 600 companies (excluding financials and oil &amp;amp;amp; gas), which account for 70 percent of overall market capitalisation, shows only a mild 3 percent uptick in revenue growth,&amp;amp;rdquo; says the CRISIL note. Quarter-on-quarter, this growth works out to 0.93 percent, a tad better than the 0.7 percent sequential growth for the March quarter. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) margins could shrink 70 basis points year-on-year, estimates CRISIL. Bank of America Merill Lynch sees Sensex consolidated profit growth to be a mere 0.3 percent. Excluding financials, aggregate profit is seen falling 4.4 percent. The brokerage forecasts a 2.8 percent decline in aggregate sales of Sensex companies, the third consecutive quarter of contraction. The sluggish earnings growth spells bad news at a time when Indian equities are not exactly cheap. &amp;amp;ldquo;Both Nifty and Sensex are trading at about 18 times March 2016 (earnings); so clearly valuations are on the higher side,&amp;amp;rdquo; Sanjeev Prasad of Kotak Institutional Equities told CNBC-TV18 earlier this week. &amp;amp;ldquo;More importantly when you look at valuation by sector then most of the growth stocks that you want to own in India are very expensive,&amp;amp;rdquo; he said. But one also has to bear in mind that the overall Sensex growth could be dragged down by a handful of companies. &amp;amp;ldquo;Profits are expected to be dented primarily due to metal companies and Tata Motors,&amp;quot; broking firm Edelweiss said in its note to clients. The broking firm expects Sensex companies&amp;amp;rsquo; topline and bottomline to decline 2.7 percent and 2.4 percent respectively, year-on-year. Tata Motors&amp;amp;nbsp;is expected to be hurt by weak demand for luxury cars in China over the last couple of months, and this trend could persist for a while because of the slowing economy, say analysts tracking China&amp;amp;rsquo;s auto sector. Silver Linings But it is not all gloom out there, say analysts. According to Bank of America Merrill, aggregate EBITDA margins for Sensex companies are expected to expand 75 basis points year-on-year. Edelweiss points out that if commodity companies were to be excluded, topline growth will be a more respectable 7 percent year-on-year. CRISIL is betting on sectors like telecom and petrochemicals to report a better performance. Analysts at Morgan Stanley say domestic sectors in general will fare better than companies with a global exposure. &amp;amp;ldquo;On a sectoral basis, estimates suggests that energy (namely oil PSUs), consumer discretionaries, industrials, telecoms and utilities will report better growth numbers versus the previous quarter,&amp;amp;rdquo; says the Morgan Stanley note, while cautioning that the earnings growth recovery is still a quarter away. Likely best and worst performers According to BoAML, banks (HDFC Bank, Axis Bank), telecom (Bharti) are expected to lead the growth and metals (Tata Steel) industrials (L&amp;amp;amp;T) and autos may drag growth. Among Sensex companies Cipla, BHEL, ONGC,&amp;amp;nbsp;HDFC Bank and&amp;amp;nbsp;Bharti are expected to be the key growth drivers. On the other hand Tata Steel, GAIL,&amp;amp;nbsp;Sun Pharma and L&amp;amp;amp;T are likely to be laggards. CRISIL feels that rural consumption will continue to drag, in turn hurting companies heavily dependent on hinterland such as FMCG, tractors, and motorcycles. &amp;amp;ldquo;The FMCG sector reported just over 7 percent topline growth in the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2015,&amp;amp;rdquo; says the CRISIL note. &amp;amp;ldquo;We do not foresee growth outpacing in the quarter ended June 30, 2015. Likewise, tractor manufacturers are expected to witness a 20 percent decline in sales volumes,&amp;quot; the note says. Edelweiss sees capex cycle picking up with engineering and capital goods to log 3 percent Y-o-Y topline growth, after contracting for eight straight quarters. &amp;amp;ldquo;Some segments of consumption are also expected to improve with domestic auto companies expected to post 12 percent annual topline growth,&amp;amp;rdquo; says the Edelweiss note, which also predicts strong growth for private sector banks. Among Sensex companies, the broking firm expects Bajaj Auto,&amp;amp;nbsp;Maruti Suzuki and Cipla to do well, and Tata Steel,&amp;amp;nbsp;Wipro and Tata Motors to disappoint. &amp;amp;nbsp;","Axis Bank, Bajaj Auto, Bank of America Merill Lynch, Bharat Heavy Electricals, Bharti Airtel, Brokerage Results Estimates, Cipla, CRISIL Research, Edelweiss, GAIL India, HDFC Bank, L&T Finance Holdings, Larsen and Toubro, Maruti Suzuki India, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, Wipro","CRISIL Research,Bank of America Merill Lynch,Edelweiss,HDFC Bank,Axis Bank,Bharti Airtel,Tata Steel,L&amp;amp;T Finance Holdings,Larsen and Toubro,Cipla,Bharat Heavy Electricals,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,GAIL India,Sun Pharmaceutical Industries,Bajaj Auto,Maruti Suzuki India,Wipro,Tata Motors",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/brokerage-results-estimates/q1-earnings-to-be-tepid-analysts-pick-bestworst-sectors_1851881.html

The gas is carried to shore by two under-sea pipelines, a 42-inch line and a 32-inch line.The company plans to carry out repair work on the 42-inch pipeline that carries natural gas from the Bassein field to Hazira, from July 7 to 27. &amp;quot;The repair work was to last 24 days but we have squeezed it in less than three week,&amp;quot; a top official said. &amp;quot;The repair work is to tentatively start from July 7 but could be pushed back to July 8 or 9.&amp;quot;This would lead to stoppage of production at some wells. &amp;quot;The output will fall by 13-14 mmscmd during the shutdown period,&amp;quot; he said.State gas utility&amp;amp;nbsp;GAIL&amp;amp;nbsp;India&amp;amp;nbsp;Ltd, which sells gas produced from the ONGC fields to the customers, has been intimated of the shutdown.GAIL will supply liquefied natural gas (LNG) purchased from spot market to the fertiliser plants that will be deprived of the ONGC gas.&amp;quot;Power plants have said that they are not in such a dire need and they can manage without ONGC supplies. However, fertiliser plants have asked for alternate supplies.&amp;quot;They do not want GAIL to give them&amp;amp;nbsp;LNG&amp;amp;nbsp;procured from Qatar on long-term contract as it costs most. Fertiliser plants want GAIL to supply LNG from spot market which is 40 percent cheaper than Qatar gas,&amp;quot; the official said.GAIL has promised to look at procuring LNG from spot market and supplying fertiliser plants.The official said the loss of gas to city gas distribution (CGD) companies that sell CNG to automobiles and piped cooking gas to households in cities, will be made good by GAIL without charging them anything extra.While the domestic gas is priced at USD 4.66 per million British thermal unit, LNG in the spot market is available at USD 7-8 per mmBtu. LNG from Qatar on a long-term contract costs almost USD 13.Shares of ONGC and GAIL reversed gains after reports of the shutdown. ONGC fell 0.31 percent to close at Rs 309.40 on&amp;amp;nbsp;BSE&amp;amp;nbsp;while GAIL dropped 0.52 percent to close at Rs 385.40.The official said the smaller 32-inch line will continue to operate and some gas is also being diverted to an alternate line that goes to Uran in Maharashtra.Gas from BG Group operated Panna/Mukta and Tapti fields in the western offshore too was carried on to-be-repaired 42-inch pipeline but was last month shifted to the 32-inch line. So its 5.8 mmscmd output would not be impacted, he said.","Arabian Sea, Business, GAIL India, LNG, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, ONGC, PTI, Qatar, Tapti","PTI,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,ONGC,Arabian sea,GAIL India,LNG,Qatar,Tapti",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-to-cut-gas-production-by-40_1784321.html

As a corporate philosophy, we like ONGC Videsh to raise funds through debts, Sarraf said. OVL has 35 projects in 16 countries - from Brazil to New Zealand - and is looking at certain acquisitions in oil and gas rich regions. Meanwhile, ONGC said it will spend around Rs 500 crore towards corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities. &amp;quot;We are spending around Rs 500 crore towards CSR activities.

2015-06-18T15:04:05+05:30,ONGC,Faizan Javed,ONGC supports Cairn plea for Raj block's term extension,"Cairn, which holds 30 percent interest in the Rajasthan block, wants to retain the Rajasthan block beyond the contractual deadline of 2020. And for such an extension the nod of the state-owned firm, which is a licence of the block holding 30 percent interest, was necessary.","As a shot in the arm for Cairn&amp;amp;nbsp;India, its partner Oil and Natural Gas Corp&amp;amp;nbsp;has asked thegovernment to extend the tenure of prolific Rajasthan oil&amp;amp;nbsp;block by 10 years without any changes in terms and conditions. Cairn, which holds 30 percent interest in the Rajasthan&amp;amp;nbsp;block, wants to retain the Rajasthan block beyond the&amp;amp;nbsp;contractual deadline of 2020. And for such an extension the&amp;amp;nbsp;nod of the state-owned firm, which is a licence of the block&amp;amp;nbsp;holding 30 percent interest, was necessary. ONGC has agreed to the Cairn proposal and written to the&amp;amp;nbsp;Oil Ministry saying the licence term should be extended by 10&amp;amp;nbsp;years on the existing terms and conditions, a top officialsaid. Unlike in 2011, when it had given conditional approval&amp;amp;nbsp;for Cairn being acquired by Vedanta&amp;amp;nbsp;Group to resolve the&amp;amp;nbsp;royalty dispute, ONGC has not put any pre-condition this time. After ONGC nod, the ministry has now sought a view from&amp;amp;nbsp;the upstream regulator, the DGH for extension of the license&amp;amp;nbsp;term, he said.&amp;amp;nbsp;Cairn's contractual term for exploring and producing oil&amp;amp;nbsp;and gas from the Rajasthan Block RJ-ON-90/2 expires in 2020&amp;amp;nbsp;and the area is to return to the block licensee, ONGC. The Anil Agarwal-group company, which wants the term of&amp;amp;nbsp;the block extended by a minimum 10 years, had in July 2014&amp;amp;nbsp;formally written to ONGC on the issue, the official said. ONGC had previously told the ministry that the production&amp;amp;nbsp;sharing contract (PSC) can be extended beyond 2020 if all&amp;amp;nbsp;parties to the contract agree on mutually agreeable terms.&amp;amp;nbsp;The official said the PSC states that the contractual&amp;amp;nbsp;term can be extended for 5 years if there remains oil to be&amp;amp;nbsp;produced and by 10 years if it is a gas bearing block. Cairn says it has a significant Raageshwari gas discovery&amp;amp;nbsp;in the block and so the term should be extended by 10 years, a&amp;amp;nbsp;contention that the state-owned ONGC has now backed.&amp;amp;nbsp;The state-owned firm was to decide on terms on which it&amp;amp;nbsp;can agree on allowing Cairn to continue to operate the fields. ONGC as a licensee of the block, which produces about&amp;amp;nbsp;160,000 barrels per day of oil, pays royalty to the government&amp;amp;nbsp;on not just its 30 percent stake but also on Cairn's 70 percent interest. Though the royalty is later cost recovered (as per the&amp;amp;nbsp;2011 agreement between Cairn and ONGC), the company faces cash&amp;amp;nbsp;flow issues because of having to pay in advance.&amp;amp;nbsp;For agreeing to Cairn's proposal, there was a view in&amp;amp;nbsp;ONGC that a condition be put that royalty will be shared by&amp;amp;nbsp;the partners in proportion to their shareholding. Also, it&amp;amp;nbsp;must seek a higher stake of 50 percent.&amp;amp;nbsp;The official said ONGC has not put any condition.","Business, Business Partnership, Cairn India, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, oil ministry, Vedanta","Cairn India,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Vedanta,Oil Ministry,Business Partnership",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-supports-cairn-plea-for-raj-blocks-term-extension_1542481.html

At current trading price of Rs 820, the stake sale will fetch the government over Rs 1,778 crore. The government holds 54.93 percent stake in BPCL. Divesting 3 percent interest will help government keep its shareholding well above 51 percent - the minimum strategic holding it has decided to keep in key public sector unit.

2015-06-11T17:24:26+05:30,ONGC,Faizan Javed,Govt to hike Cairn's Ravva gas price by 20%,"The company had sought .75 per mmBtu, a price it had discovered by inviting bids from consumers in the region. But the oil ministry is inclined to fix the rates at USD 4.2 per mmBtu for the period from June 2010 to November 2014, when a new international hub-based rate came into effect.","The government is likely to raise the price of natural gas produced from Cairn India's eastern offshore Ravva field by 20 percent to USD 4.2 with effect from June 2010. The Ravva field is divided into two - Contract Area-1 which produces about 8 million standard cubic feet per day of gas (mmscfd) and Ravva Satellite that generates around 20 mmscfd. Cairn gets USD 4.3 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) for gas from Ravva Satellite field while it gets USD 3.5 for Contract Area-1. &amp;quot;Even though Cairn gets USD 3.5 for Contract Area-1, GAIL India sells the same gas to consumers at USD 4.2 per mmBtu. The difference is credited to a gas pool account,&amp;quot; a government official said. He said when consumers are charged USD 4.2, the producer too should get the same price. &amp;quot;There certainly is a case for revision in price as is being demanded by Cairn,&amp;quot; he added. Once approved by competent authorities, Cairn will get the USD 4.2 price from June 2010, the date from which GAIL has been selling Ravva Contract Area-1 gas at rates similar to the one fixed for state-owned ONGC. Cairn has been demanding revision in price of gas from the Bay of Bengal fields effective December 1, 2008. According to the production sharing contract for the Ravva fields, gas prices were to be revised from the aforesaid date, the official said. The company had sought .75 per mmBtu, a price it had discovered by inviting bids from consumers in the region. But the oil ministry is inclined to fix the rates at USD 4.2 per mmBtu for the period from June 2010 to November 2014, when a new international hub-based rate came into effect. This price will be before addition of transportation charges, marketing margin and local taxes. Cairn says it is entitled to a higher price of gas from December 1, 2008, till when the .5 per mmBtu rate was valid. State-owned gas utility GAIL India, which buys all of the gas produced from Ravva and the adjoining Ravva Satellite fields, was opposed to paying USD 6.75 per mmBtu rate. The official said GAIL has been asked to negotiate with Cairn on USD 4.2 price from June 2010.

A government official said there had been no change in the ban and that Cairn India might simply be trying to establish a price for its oil via the tender process ahead of negotiations to sell it to local buyers. Cairn India, backed by billionaire Anil Agarwal, did not respond to telephone calls and an email seeking comment about the export notice. India is the world's fourth-biggest oil consumer and imports about 80 percent of its oil needs, leading it to place restrictions on the export of locally-produced oil. Despite this, Cairn India has sought expressions of interest from &amp;quot;reputed prospective international buyers&amp;quot; for the export of about three to five cargoes of 600,000 barrels each in the quarter starting October, according to the copy of the notice. &amp;quot;They may be looking at discovering price for their oil because the previous pricing formula was valid till March 31 and also now oil prices have declined,&amp;quot; said the government official, who declined to be named. Cairn India has been selling oil to Reliance Industries&amp;amp;nbsp;, Essar Oil&amp;amp;nbsp;and Indian Oil Corp&amp;amp;nbsp;for the past five years on the basis of a negotiated formula that allows a discount of about 10-15 percent to Brent rates . Demand for Cairn India's oil in the current fiscal year is likely to be higher than a year ago. Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd's managing director H. Kumar said recently his firm could buy 8,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Rajasthan crude this fiscal year, while Indian Oil Corp plans to raise purchases buy a third to 40,000 bpd.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet will soon consider the deal which would also require raising the authorised capital of the subsidiary ONGC Videsh (OVL) by half to 150 billion rupees, said three sources aware of the matter. With an improved debt-to-equity ratio, OVL would be able to independently raise funds on the strength of its balance sheet instead of relying on ONGC's financial status. ONGC's total loans to OVL stand at about 66.14 billion rupees. The 50 billion loan was given by ONGC to help OVL acquire a stake in a Mozambique gas field. Jagannadham Thunuguntla, head of fundamental research at Karvy Group, noted company restructurings often happen before flotations, adding: &amp;quot;It will give more legroom for additional fundraising by OVL to finance future acquisitions.&amp;quot; ONGC did a similar loan-to-equity conversion for OVL in 2013, which has invested about USD 23.8 billion on its exploration and production assets in 17 countries. OVL Managing Director N.K. Verma declined comment on the latest cabinet proposal but said: &amp;quot;In the past we had contemplated converting part of the debt into equity to improve our balance sheet and provide flexibility for financing new acquisitions&amp;quot;. The oil ministry has asked ONGC to consider a stock market listing of OVL, though a company executive said in May it would favour delaying such a move given low oil prices. Any listing would help ONGC raise funds from the market and increase payouts to the government, which is looking for 695 billion rupees through stake sales in state companies to help narrow the fiscal deficit to 3.9 percent of gross domestic product from last year's 4 percent.","Business, Jagannadham Thunuguntla, Mozambique, N.K.

2015-04-27T17:37:31+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,India asks Qatar to lower LNG price to match global slump,"India buys 7.5 million tonnes a year of LNG on a long-term 25 year contract, indexed to a moving average of crude oil price.","India has asked its largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplier Qatar to cut gas prices to match the 60 percent slump in global rates in last one year. India buys 7.5 million tonnes a year of LNG on a long-term 25 year contract, indexed to a moving average of crude oil price. The price of LNG from Qatar comes close to USD 13 per million British thermal unit as compared to the USD 6-7 rate at which it is available in the spot or current market. The high price of LNG under the long-term contract has led to users in fertiliser and power industry finding it cheaper to use alternate fuels like naphtha and fuel oil, a top source said. Petronet LNG Ltd, which has been buying LNG from Qatar on a long-term contract since 2004, has asked for a 10 percent cut in import volumes this year, they said. &amp;quot;The contract is a take or pay wherein the buyer has to take the contracted volume every calendar year or pay for it.&amp;amp;nbsp;But the contract also provides for a flexibility that gives the buyer (the option) to defer taking 10 percent less of yearly supplies. These volumes can be taken at anytime during the duration of the contract,&amp;quot; the source said. Similarly, the contract also provides for the buyer to seek 10 percent more quantity over the contracted volume in any year, with the excess volume being adjusted during the remaining duration of the contract. The source said Petronet has already exercised the 10 percent option and is in negotiations to raise this volume to 25 percent. Petronet, which is a joint venture of state-owned oil companies, wants these deferred volumes at the price at which LNG from spot market is currently available. It feels that by averaging the long-term price and the spot rate, it can sell Qatar LNG to consumers, the source said. LNG from Qatar, on the long-term, was once considered the cheapest. The fuel cost USD 2.53 per mmBtu for the first five years, from 2004 to 2009. For the next five years, the price was linked to moving average of crude oil price of last 5 years and thereafter direct indexation with crude oil. The source said Qatar has so far not responded to India's request. &amp;quot;We have told them that India is a big consumer of their gas. India bought over 14 million tonnes of LNG in 2014.&amp;amp;nbsp;Of this, over 12 million tonnes came from Qatar.

With Tapti output declining rapidly, partners in the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields - RIL, BG and ONGC, have decided to abandon the field.","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation&amp;amp;nbsp;has agreed to take over a part of the abandoned assets of the western offshore Tapti gas field from its joint venture partners Reliance Industries&amp;amp;nbsp;and BG once output falls to zero. With Tapti output declining rapidly, partners in the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields - RIL, BG and ONGC, have decided to abandon the field. &amp;quot;Tapti abandonment (has) achieved resolution with Government of India,&amp;quot; RIL said a presentation to analysts after the company's fourth-quarter results.  Gas output from the field has almost halved to 14.2 billion cubic feet (bcf) in 2014-15 while oil production was 0.2 million barrels, down 22 per cent from previous fiscal. RIL said: &amp;quot;ONGC will take over Tapti Part A facilities in accordance with Tapti Production Sharing Contract (PSC) along with abandonment obligation.&amp;quot; The other part will be abandoned. &amp;quot;Joint venture (will be) responsible for abandonment obligation for the Tapti Part B facilities,&amp;quot; it said.  Abandonment means dismantling and removing infrastructure set up for production of oil and gas. ONGC official said the company plans to use the Tapti field assets, which include sub-sea pipelines and gas gathering stations as well as process platform, to advance production of gas from its neighbouring Daman field. The assets include Tapti gas processing platform, which received gas from sub-sea wells, removes water and other impurities before transmitting it to onshore.  ONGC will lay a small length of pipeline from the Daman field to the process platform, which is connected by a 70-km pipeline to its facility at Hazira. The official said the company is investing Rs 5,219 crore in bringing to production the Daman gas fields. Production is expected by July 2016 at the rate of 2 million standard cubic meters per day and peak output of 8.35 mmscmd of gas and 9,286 barrels of condensate per day is likely by 2018-19, he said.  ONGC holds 40 per cent interest in the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields while RIL and BP have 30 per cent each. The joint venture will continue to operate the Panna-Mukta field, which primarily is an oil bearing field located 90-km north-west of Mumbai in the Arabian Sea. It produced 7.2 million barrels of oil and 70.7 bcf of gas.  According to RIL, the oil production from Panna-Mukta was almost flat while gas registered 8 per cent increase. Primarily gas-bearing Tapti field is located 160 km north-west of Mumbai and is currently producing about one million standard cubic meters per day and even this output is expected to taper off to zero before the year end. The Panna-Mukta fields are expected to stay in production till fiscal 2019.","Arabian Sea, Business, Mukta, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Reliance Industries, Tapti gas field, Tapti Production Sharing Contract","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Tapti gas field,Reliance Industries,Mukta,Tapti Production Sharing Contract,Arabian Sea",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-to-take-over-tapti-gas-field-facilities_1361831.html

While the BJP-led government had approved an international gas hub-based formula for all of the domestically produced natural gas in November last year, small and isolated fields were exempt. The Oil Ministry on April 1 issued amendment to the guidelines for pricing of gas from small and isolated fields by allowing producers to sell gas at market rates by inviting competitive bids from prospective consumers. Companies will fix minimum price for their gas, which would be the prevailing government-determined rate, and ask interested buyers to offer more through bidding, officials said. Government had on March 31 announced USD 4.66 per million British thermal unit as the gas price for six-month period ending September 30 based on the approved formula. &amp;quot;In case of new supplies, the price would be determined by NOCs (national oil companies) by calling bids through an open competitive bidding process,&amp;quot; the guideline said. The ministry guidelines state that it was imperative that NOCs are able to quickly monetise the output of their discoveries particularly marginal ones where where production is small and fields are isolated. The guidelines defined such fields as ones &amp;quot;whose peak production is less than 0.1 million standard cubic meters per day and they are situated more than 10 km away from the gas grid.&amp;quot; Also, &amp;quot;fields whose peak production is less than 0.1 mmscmd and have a gas pressure which is less than the grid pressure&amp;quot; have also been defined as small/isolated fields. Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) have several such discoveries, which cumulatively produce around 3-4 mmscmd, enough to generate about 900 MW electricity. Officials said while the guidelines issued on April 1 are for additional or new production from small/isolated fields, ONGC had in November last year used e-tendering to finalise a price of USD 10.10-11.20 per mmBtu for sale of gas from new marginal fields in Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh. ONGC has finalised a price of USD 10.10 per mmBtu for gas from Gamij-GGS-2 field and a rate of USD 11.10 per mmBtu for Gamij-GGS-3 field, both in Gujarat.

Cairn currently produces around 1 mmscmd of gas from the Raageshwari gas field in the Barmer district block RJ-ON-90/1. In an application to the downstream regulator Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) seeking approval to lay a pipeline to Gujarat for transporting gas, Cairn said it plans to drill a minimum of 42 more wells to augment and sustain the gas supply in the next three years. &amp;quot;Drilling for new wells is expected to start in Q1 of FYs 2016-17 with contracting for drilling rig, related equipment and services at an advanced stage,&amp;quot; it said in the March 16 application. Cairn said it is further developing the field &amp;quot;on a fast track-basis to increase the gas production from the block to cater to the significant unmet demand for gas in the country.&amp;quot; The gas produced from the Raageshwari Deep Gas (RGD) field would be gathered and treated at the proposed RDG terminal at Gudamalani in Barmer district, from where it will be evacuated through a new 194-km, 24-inch pipeline to the nearest available gas grid which is the GSPL's Gujarat Gas Grid with connectivity at Palanpur terminal. &amp;quot;Given the advanced status of gas producing wells and surface facilities, we envisage gas production through the new facilities latest by H12017,&amp;quot; Cairn said. &amp;quot;Subsequent to ramp-up over a period of one year (from H1, 2017), the estimated gas production will be 3 mmscmd plateau for a period of five years with an overall profile of 15 years.&amp;quot; Out of this, around 2.6 mmscmd will be for external sales, while the rest will be for internal consumption in the RJ Block and for meeting the heating requirements, it said. The field has recoverable gas reserves of 359 billion cubic feet (10.25 billion cubic meters).

ONGC Videsh (OVL), the overseas arm of the state explorer, was among the international firms which signed up to pre-qualify for Mexico's inaugural Round-1 bid offering at the end of deadline on March 31, industry sources said. The company is pitched against the US majors ExxonMobile and Chevron, Anglo-Dutch firm Shell as well as national oil companies and Mexican players for 14 shallow water exploration blocks in the country's southern region. Other majors in fray include Mexican state-owned petroleum company Pemex, Norway's Statoil, Colombia's EcoPetrol, Brazil's Petrobras and PTTEP of Thailand. Mexico is opening up its oil sector to private players for the first time after more than 75 years of monopoly by state company Petr�leos Mexicanos or Pemex. Sources said the blocks on offer may hold prospective resources and are estimated at 3.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Other global players which have bid include Australia's BHP Billiton, BG Group, BP and Premier Oil of the UK, Italy's Eni, Portugal's Galp, Spain's Cepsa, Russia's Lukoil, Denmark's Maersk, Japan's Inpex and Total of France. Jogmec, Japex and Mitsubishi of Japan, privately held independent Casa Exploration and Mexican player Petrobal as well as Canada's Nexen and Pacific Rubiales are also in fray. American independents, including Cobalt, Hess, Marathon, Murphy, and Noble -- already active in their home sector of the Gulf of Mexico -- have also put in pre-qualification bids. According to the bid criteria, companies will have an initial exploration period of four years, with the possibility of a two-year extension. They also have to drill at least one well after winning the block. While Mexico is offering shallow waters in the Gulf of Mexico in Round-1, more costly production in shale rock formations will be offered later. Mexico is expecting USD 50 billion investment through opening up its exploration sector to private and foreign players by 2018. OVL has interests in 33 oil and gas assets in 16 countries and contributes to 14.5 per cent and 8 per cent of oil and natural gas production of India, respectively. In terms of reserves and production, it is the second largest petroleum company of India, next only to its parent ONGC.","Business, gas, oil, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, ONGC Videsh, PTI","PTI,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,oil,gas,ONGC Videsh",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-eyes-mexican-oilgas-blocks_1349037.html

The total consideration of the transaction is about Rs 426 crore,&amp;quot; the company said in a statement here. This consummates the equity structure as was envisaged at the time of setting up the project. ONGC formed OTPC for implementation of a gas based 726.6 MW combined cycle thermal power project at Palatana, Tripura. The project was conceived to utilise the stranded gas reserves of ONGC found in the state so as to aid in the economic progress of the north-eastern states. The project is backed by a long term gas supply agreement with ONGC, while the power off-take is tied up on long term basis with the seven north-eastern states. OTPC also owns 26 percent stake in North East Transmission Company Limited (NETCL), a joint-venture company of OTPC, Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd and the 7 north-eastern states.

2015-04-01T08:17:25+05:30,ONGC,Nazim Khan,Over 250 cos appoint women directors to meet Sebi deadline,"Among the large Sensex and Nifty companies, the three non-compliant firms till late evening were ONGC, PNB and BPCL -- all of them public sector entities, as per the status update report submitted by exchanges to Sebi. It could not be ascertained whether these companies made compliance with Sebi norms later in the night.","Waking up at the last moment, over 250 companies including from Adani and Essar Groups, appointed women directors to meet the Sebi deadline of Tuesday midnight for having at least one female board member, even as some PSUs were seen lagging behind. The companies have, however, mostly appointed wives or daughters of their promoters or top executives, while some have also replaced their independent directors with their female family members, mainly wives, daughters or sisters. Among the large Sensex and Nifty companies, the three non-compliant firms till late evening were ONGC, PNB&amp;amp;nbsp;and BPCL&amp;amp;nbsp;-- all of them public sector entities, as per the status update report submitted by exchanges to Sebi. It could not be ascertained whether these companies made compliance with Sebi norms later in the night. Overall, more than 1,000 listed companies did not have even one woman director till late hours, but most of them were small and little-known entities including those below the threshold equity capital base of Rs 10 crore for these norms. More than 250 companies however, appointed women directors on Tuesday. The numbers can rise further as board meetings were scheduled till late night to comply with the norms, which were first announced in February 2014 with an initial deadline of October 1, 2014. It was later extended by 6 months. On Tuesday too, meetings continued till almost midnight and nearly 200 companies made such appointments as part of last-minute rush that began late last week after a stern warning from the regulator. Tuesday onwards, the companies without a woman director may face penal action under the Sebi regulations, as also under the Companies Act, including monetary fines. While Sebi norms provide for penalty of up to Rs 25 crore, the penalty under the Companies Act can be from Rs 5,000 to Rs 5 lakh. Sources said the stock exchanges were asked by Sebi to submit a compliance status on Tuesday, while a final update would be provided on Tuesday after taking into account late-night filings. Subsequently, Sebi will look into the final compliance status and begin the process for undertaking necessary action against the non-compliant companies. Similar action would be initiated by the Corporate Affairs Ministry for non-compliance to the Companies Act provisions. The companies which appointed women members on their boards as independent directors on Tuesday included Adani Power, Adani Ports&amp;amp;nbsp;and SEZ, Essar Oil, Golden Tobacco, Prime Capital Market, Linc Pen&amp;amp;nbsp;and Plastics&amp;amp;nbsp;and Kohinoor Foods. Other companies that announced appointments of women directors on Tuesday were GVK Power, Dhampure Specialty Sugars, Ashoka Buildcon, ABG Infralogistics, Surya Roshni Ltd, Bharati Shipyard, India Home Loan Ltd, Landmark Property, Donear Industries Ltd&amp;amp;nbsp;and Nitesh Estates. At least 80 companies on Tuesday announced appointment of women directors as independent board members, while another 110 appointed non-independent female directors. There are more than 5,000 companies listed on the BSE, while NSE has nearly 1,650 entities on its platform. Till evening, nearly 200 NSE-listed companies were yet to comply, while the number could be higher at the BSE. However, nearly half the appointments made by the companies were of the persons from within the families of the promoters or top executives. The companies that have decided to appoint women directors as independent members of their boards seem to have preferred bankers and chartered accountants, shows an analysis of the announcements made by listed firms in last few days. A few companies, such as United Breweries Holdings Ltd, have opted for a foreign national to be appointed as a woman director, while many of them have decided to promote a senior management personnel to the board. To meet the deadline, many firms are appointing the same women executives on boards of their various group companies. Some companies have, however, expressed their inability to meet the deadline, while citing reasons ranging from a sudden exit of existing women directors to 'lack of quorum' in their board meetings to make an appointment. Sebi has warned of strict penal action against the firms that fail to comply, while Chairman U K Sinha recently said it was &amp;quot;really shameful&amp;quot; that many companies were not being able to appoint even one woman director. The companies are required to appoint women directors as per the new Corporate Governance regime ushered in by Sebi in 2014, which also included various measures with regard to independent directors and top management salaries to safeguard the interest of small investors. Earlier, the new regime was applicable to all the listed firms. Sebi later exempted smaller companies -- those having equity share capital of up to Rs 10 crore and networth not exceeding Rs 25 crore, as also those listed on the SME platforms of the stock exchanges -- from the mandatory compliance &amp;quot;for the time being&amp;quot;.","ABG Infralogistics, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, Adani Power, Ashoka Buildcon, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, Bharati Shipyard, BSE, Business, Dhampure Specialty Sugars, Donear Industries, Essar Oil, Golden Tobacco, GVK Power & Infrastructure, India Home Loans, Kohinoor Foods, Landmark Property Development Company, Linc Pen and Plastics, Nifty, Nitesh Estates, NSE, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Prime Capital Market, Punjab National Bank, SEBI, Sensex, Surya Roshni, U K Sinha, United Breweries Holdings, Women","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Punjab National Bank,Bharat Petroleum Corporation,Adani Power,Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone,Essar Oil,Golden Tobacco,Prime Capital Market,Linc Pen and Plastics,Kohinoor Foods,GVK Power &amp;amp; Infrastructure,Dhampure Specialty Sugars,Ashoka Buildcon,ABG Infralogistics,Surya Roshni,Bharati Shipyard,India Home Loans,Landmark Property Development Company,Donear Industries,Nitesh Estates,United Breweries Holdings,U K Sinha,Sebi,Women,BSE,NSE,Nifty,Sensex",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/over-250-cos-appoint-women-directors-to-meet-sebi-deadline_1345969.html

The insurance cover, due for renewal on May 11, has been renewed in the London markets, market sources said. Global general insurance prices have been heading south as claims have been lower unlike the previous year wherein claims were higher due to many catastrophes and aviation accidents. &amp;quot;ONGC has renewed its insurance account for its offshore assets worth USD 34 billion for a premium of around USD 20 million, more than 35 percent lower than what it had paid for existing cover of USD 33 million,&amp;quot; industry sources told Media. The cover was underwritten by United India Insurance, while the reinsurance cover has come from two global reinsurers -- Endurance and Aspirin -- which outbid GIC Re, the country's sole reinsurer to bag the ONGC account until now, sources added. ONGC, which holds the biggest insurance policy in the country at USD 33 million, had last week floated a tender to underwriters to primarily cover its offshore assets. Air India paid USD 27 million for its cover in the outgoing fiscal, making it the second biggest account. The cover for large corporates like Reliance Industries, Jet Airways&amp;amp;nbsp;among others are about to be renewed and they may get benefit of the softening general insurance market. However, airlines may be forced to shell out more following the last week's Germanwings airline crash.

With international oil prices almost halving to USD 50 per barrel, providing the subsidy discounts would have meant they got rates way below their cost of production.","Government is likely to exempt oil producers ONGC&amp;amp;nbsp;and Oil India Ltd&amp;amp;nbsp;from payment of fuel subsidy in the fourth quarter ending March 31, a senior Petroleum Ministry official said on Friday. &amp;amp;ldquo;We have a verbal assurance from the Finance Ministry that upstream companies will not have to bear any subsidy in the fourth quarter,&amp;amp;rdquo; the official said on the sidelines of &amp;amp;lsquo;Urja Sangam&amp;amp;rsquo; conference. The government regulates price of cooking fuels &amp;amp;mdash; LPG and kerosene &amp;amp;mdash; to shield the poor. The difference between the cost and the retail selling price is borne by the government by way of cash subsidy and upstream producers like ONGC. Under-recoveries, or revenue retailers&amp;amp;rsquo; loss on selling fuel below cost, are projected to be Rs 74,773 crore in the 2014-15 fiscal. Of this, Rs 67,091 crore has already been accounted for in the first nine months of the fiscal and compensation mechanism decided. The remainder of the under-recoveries can be borne by the government, he said, adding that this subsidy will be rolled over to the next fiscal. &amp;amp;ldquo;This is what is our broad understanding from the Finance Ministry though I must add that we have not seen any letter from them to this effect,&amp;amp;rdquo; he said. When contacted, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said his ministry and the Ministry of Finance are working together to formulate a subsidy-sharing mechanism. This mechanism will be based on the principal that the profitability of the government and the companies are not impacted, he said. &amp;amp;ldquo;Their profitability is complementary to each other.&amp;amp;rdquo; In the first nine months, the government gave cash subsidy of Rs 22,085 crore to meet less than a third of the under-recoveries on cooking fuel and diesel (up to October 17). Upstream oil producers ONGC, OIL and GAIL&amp;amp;nbsp;chipped in Rs 42,822 crore. The upstream subsidy contribution is by way of discount on crude oil they sell to refineries. With international oil prices almost halving to USD 50 per barrel, providing the subsidy discounts would have meant they got rates way below their cost of production. ONGC&amp;amp;rsquo;s cost of production is around USD 40 per barrel. The official said the finance ministry is likely to pay Rs 7,682 crore as cash subsidy for the fourth quarter. The Oil Ministry had projected that government will earn Rs 75,944 crore from excise duty on petrol and diesel this fiscal and even after paying for Rs 39,101 crore subsidy (Rs 17,000 crore of first half and Rs 22,101 crore in second half), it will be left with Rs 36,843 crore.","Business, Dharmendra Pradhan, Finance Ministry, GAIL India, kerosene, LPG, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Oil India, Petroleum Ministry, subsidy, Urja Sangam","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Oil India,Finance Ministry,Urja Sangam,LPG,kerosene,Petroleum Ministry,subsidy,Dharmendra Pradhan,GAIL India",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/govt-may-exempt-ongc-oilpaying-subsidyq4_1342053.html

Also, entities authorised by PNGRB or Central Government would also be eligible. &amp;quot;The eligible entities under these guidelines shall apply to the Government for issuance of 'Grant of Marketing Rights for CNG as transportation fuel',&amp;quot; the guideline says. Since 2006, entities apply to PNGRB and not the government for rights to retail CNG alongside selling natural gas as fuel within city limits. While PNGRB has been issuing the licence to retail CNG as well as piped cooking gas (PNG), the ministry guidelines pertain only to rights to sell CNG. &amp;quot;The entities which have already been granted marketing rights for petrol, diesel and ATF as transportation fuel, under Resolution dated March 8, 2002 will be deemed to have such grants of marketing rights for CNG as transportation fuel,&amp;quot; it said. In 2002, state-owned&amp;amp;nbsp;Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) besides Reliance Industries, Essar Oil, Royal Dutch Shell and Numaligarh Refineries had won authorisation to set up petrol pumps to sell petrol and diesel. Besides these firms, fuel retailers&amp;amp;nbsp;Indian Oil Corp (IOC),&amp;amp;nbsp;Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and&amp;amp;nbsp;Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) as well as gas utility&amp;amp;nbsp;GAIL India Ltd will be eligible for CNG marketing rights. Firms who get CNG marketing rights will get natural gas allocation and can book capacities in existing pipelines to transport the fuel, the guidelines said. PNGRB recently opened fifth round of bidding for city gas distribution (CGD) licences even though it had issued license to entities for only first two rounds. Licences for the remainder are stuck over disputes.","Bharat Petroleum Corporation, Business, CNG, CNG Stations, Essar Oil, GAIL India, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, Indian Oil Corporation, Indraprastha Gas, Mahanagar Gas Ltd, Numaligarh Refineries, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, oil ministry, Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board, PNGRB, Reliance Industries, Royal Dutch Shell","Oil Ministry,CNG,PNGRB,CNG Stations,Indraprastha Gas,Mahanagar Gas Ltd,Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Reliance Industries,Essar Oil,Royal Dutch Shell,Numaligarh Refineries,Indian Oil Corporation,Bharat Petroleum Corporation,Hindustan Petroleum Corporation,GAIL India",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/oil-ministry-to-give-cng-marketing-licence_1327416.html

While the Minister did not name the fields, sources said OVL was in talks for a stake in Vankor and Yurubcheno-Tokhomskoye fields.","ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), is in talks to acquire stake in two Siberian oilfields, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on wednesday. OVL is in discussions with a Russian oil company for acquiring participating interest in two Siberian oil fields,&amp;quot; he said in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha here. While the Minister did not name the fields, sources said OVL was in talks for a stake in Vankor and Yurubcheno-Tokhomskoye fields. &amp;quot;Discussions are at a preliminary stage,&amp;quot; Pradhan said. Sources said an agreement for the stake was to be signed during the visit of Russian President Vladmir Putin in December last year but differences between the two sides prevented formal signing of the pact. Russia's biggest oil company Rosneft had offered to sell 10 percent stake in the strategic Vankor oilfield in Siberia to OVL. In September, 2014, Rosneft had sold 10 per cent stake in the Vankor cluster fields in northern Siberia to China's CNPC for about USD 1 billion. Vankor is the largest field to have been discovered and brought into production in Russia in the last 25 years. As of January 1, 2014, the initial recoverable reserves in the Vankor field are estimated at 500 million tonnes of oil and condensate, and 182 billion cubic meters of gas. Vankor will reach peak output of 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) or 25 million tonnes a year in 2019. The field, which has driven recent Russian output growth, pumped 435,000 bpd in September, 2014. Russia is the world's top oil producer with current output of 10.5 million bpd but its key producing region - West Siberia - is maturing. Besides Vankor, Rosneft has also made a proposal to OVL for joint development of Yurubcheno-Tokhomskoye oilfield in eastern Siberia. The field is estimated to hold 991 million barrels of oil equivalent reserves and is planned to start production in 2017. Yurubcheno-Tokhomskoye will reach a production plateau of up to 5 million tonnes a year (100,000 bpd) in 2019. OVL is interested in expanding its presence in Russia as it looks to source one million barrels per day of oil and oil-equivalent gas from Russia. It already has 20 percent stake in Sakhalin-1 oil and gas field in Far East Russia and in 2009 acquired Imperial Energy, which has fields in Siberia, for USD 2.1 billion.&amp;amp;nbsp;","Business, CNPC, Dharmendra Pradhan, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Oil Minister, Rajya Sabha, Russia, Russian oil company, Sakhalin-1 oil and gas, Siberian, Vankor, Vankor and Yurubcheno-Tokhomskoye fields","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Siberian,Oil Minister,Dharmendra Pradhan,Russian oil company,Rajya Sabha,Vankor,Vankor and Yurubcheno-Tokhomskoye fields,Sakhalin-1 oil and gas,Russia,CNPC",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ovltalks-to-acquire-stake2-siberian-oilfields_1326145.html

It was also a signatory for receipt of gas via the proposed Iran-Pakistan-India (IPI) gas pipeline.,"State-owned gas utility GAIL India&amp;amp;nbsp;is unwilling to sign any agreement with Iranian companies for sourcing of gas because of the fear of US sanctions, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Monday. GAIL had in 2005 signed an agreement with National Iranian Gas Export Corporation (NIGEC) for import of 7.5 million tons a year of gas in its liquid form (LNG) from Iran. It was also a signatory for receipt of gas via the proposed Iran-Pakistan-India (IPI) gas pipeline. But after US imposed sanctions on Iran over its suspected nuclear programme, Indian firms are wary of entering into pacts which may lead to them being sanctioned by Washington. &amp;quot;Since GAIL has substantial business interest in the US, GAIL is unwilling to sign any agreement involving an Iranian entity until a final position emerges with respect to Iran sanctions,&amp;quot; he said in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha. Pradhan said South Asia Gas Enterprise (SAGE) is pursuing a deep-sea gas pipeline from Middle East to India for importing natural gas. It has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with NIGEC for transportation of gas to India through deep water route. &amp;quot;In the year 2011, GAIL was nominated by the Ministry (of Petroleum and Natural Gas) as the designated agency for the project,&amp;quot; he said. The company has a Principles of Cooperation (PoC) with SAGE since July 2009 where GAIL and SAGE have agreed to cooperate in the pipeline project. &amp;quot;GAIL has reservations in signing of the non-binding framework agreement forwarded by SAGE in March 2013 with an Iranian company, since it could lead to impairment of GAIL's access to international commercial or financial services and capital markets, in its global business ventures,&amp;quot; he said. The state-owned firm has 20 per cent stake in Carrizo shale gas venture in the US where it has committed to invest USD 300 million. Also, it has multiple agreements for sourcing of gas and use of LNG terminals for shipping it to India. The US Government Accountability Office (GAO) listed three Indian companies as having commercial activity in Iran's energy sector, potentially attracting US sanctions. State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp&amp;amp;nbsp;(ONGC), Oil India Ltd&amp;amp;nbsp;(OIL) and Indian Oil Corp&amp;amp;nbsp;(IOC) have been on the list since 2010 for having stakes in Iran's Farsi oil and gas field.

ONGC will drill over 350 wells in three blocks in Jharia, Bokaro and North Karanpur in Jharkhand. A fourth block in Ranigajan North in West Bengal may be relinquished as it may fall in way of a planned air-strip. &amp;quot;Production will start in three years and peak output of 3.2 mmscmd is likely in 2020-21,&amp;quot; he said. On pricing, he said CBM production is viable at USD 4.8 per million British thermal unit gas price. In comparison, the current government mandated rate is USD 4.24. ONGC sells CBM gas from wells at Parbatpur in the Jharia block at an approved price of USD 5.1 per mmBtu.

Pradhan said the endeavour is to bring a comprehensive and holistic policy that will help boost CBM production. Private firms like Essar Oil say pricing is inadequate and public sector companies like ONGC too in muted voices say the same thing, he said. &amp;quot;The policy will be brought after stakeholder consultations,&amp;quot; he said adding the operators will have to assure that they will increase production as well as bring in technology.He however did not give details of the policy nor a timeframe for bringing it. &amp;quot;Affordability of consumers will have to be kept in mind while framing such a policy,&amp;quot; he said. The Government has so far awarded 33 CBM blocks in four rounds of auctions. Of these, 13 blocks have either been relinquished or offered to be relinquished due to poor CBM prospectivity.Great Eastern Energy Co Ltd (GEECL) has begun production&amp;amp;nbsp; from Raniganj (South) block in West Bengal and is currently producing about 1 million standard cubic metres per day, while state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has entered the development phase in four blocks, including Raniganj (North).

2015-12-18T11:42:07+05:30,ONGC,Faizan Javed,IOC in talks to buy stake in Siberia oil project: Sources,"India, the world's fourth-biggest oil consumer, has to ship in three quarters of its oil needs and with oil prices close to their lowest since the global financial crisis has added incentive to seal purchases to limit import reliance.","Indian Oil Corp&amp;amp;nbsp;and Oil India are in talks with Russia's Rosneft to buy up to a 29 percent stake in a Siberian oil project, two sources said, as New Delhi accelerates a push to secure overseas energy assets. India, the world's fourth-biggest oil consumer, has to ship in three quarters of its oil needs and with oil prices close to their lowest since the global financial crisis has added incentive to seal purchases to limit import reliance. The deal, which could be worth around USD 1 billion based on the valuation of a recent stake purchase, is expected to take final shape during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Moscow next week for summit talks with President Vladimir Putin, said the sources with direct knowledge of the situation. Rosneft, the world's biggest listed oil company by output, also stands to benefit as it has been scouting for partners as Western sanctions tied to Russia's annexation of Crimea have limited its access to global funds and technology. Officials at the two state-run Indian firms are in Moscow to negotiate with Rosneft for up to a 29 percent stake in Rosneft's Taas-Yuriakh, the sources said, adding that the exact size and value of the stake was yet to be decided. The sources declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. Taas-Yuriakh, which operates the Srednebotuobinsk field, is expected to produce more than 5 million tonnes of oil annually from 2017. Rosneft last month sold a 20 percent share in Taas-Yuriakh to BP for USD 750 million, and based on that valuation a 29 percent stake could be worth around USD 1 billion. Rosneft said on Nov. 30 it planned to select a second partner in Taas-Yuriakh. Business development directors at the two Indian companies and Rosneft declined to comment. If the deal goes through, it would mark India's second acquisition in Russia since Modi took office in May last year and a third under the ruling Bhartiya Janata Party. In 2002, Oil and Natural Gas Corp bought a 20 percent stake in the Sakhalin I field. India has frequently lost out to China in the race to acquire resources overseas in the last decade, but its oil diplomacy has gained momentum under Modi, who has made frequent foreign trips. In September, ONGC Videsh, the overseas investment arm of oil firm ONGC, acquired a 15 percent stake in Russia's Vankor field, a deal that was sealed in July when Modi met Putin at a BRICS summit. N.K. Verma, managing director of ONGC Videsh, said the push by the Modi government meant that &amp;quot;India Inc has now been taken as a dependable partner and a serious player by the global community in the bigger projects&amp;quot;.","BP, BRICS Summit, Business, Indian Oil Corporation, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Oil India, Rosneft","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Indian Oil Corporation,Oil India,Rosneft,BP,BRICS summit",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ioctalks-to-buy-stakesiberia-oil-project-sources_4638481.html

OVL, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), will get 4 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas for the stake in Vankorneft, the developer of the Vankor oil and gas condensate field in Turukhansky district of Krasnoyak Territory in Russia. The deal, the first overseas acquisition by an oil PSU since the NDA regime came to power in May 2014, was approved at the meeting of the Cabinet this evening. Modi was keen to see the deal through which will help India's energy security, sources said. &amp;quot;We were able to get the deal through with the proactive involvement of the government,&amp;quot; OVL Managing Director N K Verma told PTI here. The field has recoverable reserves of 2.5 billion barrels. OVL had in September signed definitive agreements to acquire up to 15 percent shares in CSJC Vankorneft, a company organised under the law of Russian Federation which is the owner of Vankor Field and North Vankor licence. Rosneft, Russia's national oil company, holds 100 percent stake in Vankorneft. The acquisition is subject to relevant board, government and regulatory approvals and is expected to be completed by 2016-mid, sources said. This will be the fourth biggest acquisition by OVL. It had in 2013 paid USD 4.125 billion for a 16 percent stake in Mozambique's offshore Rovuma Area 1, which holds as much as 75 Trillion cubic feet of gas reserves. In 2009, it had bought Russia-focused Imperial Energy for USD 2.1 billion. Prior to that, it had in 2001 paid USD 1.7 billion for a 20 percent interest in the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas field off Russia's far eastern coast. &amp;quot;Vankor is Rosneft's (and Russia's) second largest field by production and accounts for 4 percent of Russian production. The daily production from the field is around 4,42,000 barrels per day of crude oil. Upon completion of the deal, OVL will have two seats on the board of Vankorneft. Rosneft, whose stake in the project will come down to 85 percent, will however keep full control of the general infrastructure of Vankor cluster, including oil pipeline Vankor-Purpe.","Business, Cabinet, government, Narendra Modi, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, oil deal, ONGC Videsh, Rosneft, Russia's Vankor oilfield","Cabinet,ONGC Videsh,Russia's Vankor oilfield,oil deal,Narendra Modi,government,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Rosneft",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/govt-nod-to-ovls-36126-bn-stake-buyvankor-field_4616101.html

Consequently, the well had to be closed and abandoned. As a result, expenditure of Rs 1,577.27 crore incurred by ONGC on drillingof the original location and drilling of a relief well by using another rig proved avoidable.&amp;quot;The insurer did not honour the claim of ONGC on the ground that the latter had not followed recognised safe operating practice,&amp;quot; the report said.Also, the company did not adhere to the repair schedule for dry dock management and major lay-up repairs of jack-up rigs which was against an efficient operational practice.Failure on the part of the company led to a situation wherein rigs were being operated with outdated/obsolete equipment, CAG said.CAG said ONGC had prepared 5-year rig requirement on the basis of RRP, which included non-operational idling time of rigs that was entirely controllable by the company.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; Annual Rig Deployment Plans (RDPs) were prepared on the basis of RRP. &amp;quot;Therefore, the Annual Rig Deployment Plans had an in-built inefficiency,&amp;quot; it said.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;amp;nbsp; While there was no uniformity in preparation of annual RDPs among the Assets and Basins of ONGC, the company failed to decide a policy on acquisition of new offshore rigs for over a decade -- from 2002 to 2015.Meanwhile, four out of six owned offshore rigs outlived their economic usable life of thirty years. CAG asked ONGC to ensure that the plans (five year plan,annual plan, rig requirement plan, rig deployment plan) are complete and consistent with each other and are complied with.The situation where one out of every three wells drilled is un-planned needs to be corrected, it said, adding that the controllable non-productive time of past periods should not be loaded to future rig requirement plans and efforts to be taken to reduce such non-productive time.","Business, CAG, Comptroller and Auditor General of India, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Parliament","Comptroller and Auditor General of India,CAG,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Parliament",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cag-raps-ongc-for-rs-8k-cr-loss-due-to-poor-rig-management_4518681.html

OVL, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), has proposed to build one LNG train of 6 million tonnes a year","ONGC Videsh Ltd-led consortium is close to winning USD 5 billion rights to develop Iran's Farzad-B gas field and convert the gas produced from it into LNG for shipping to countries like India. &amp;quot;The first development phase of Farzad-B is expected to require USD 3 billion in investment,&amp;quot; Saeed Hafezi, managing director of the Iranian Offshore Oil Company, was quoted as saying by Mehr News Agency of Iran. The gas produced from the field will be converted into liquefied natural gas (LNG) for export to consuming nations like India. OVL, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), has proposed to build one LNG train of 6 million tonnes a year. A consortium of OVL, Oil India Ltd (OIL) and Indian Oil Corp (IOC) had discovered the 12.8 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves in the Farsi block in 2008. The discovery was named Farzad-B. But the Indians firms were forced to put the project on backburner after the US and the EU introduced tough sanctions against the Persian Gulf country. However, the agreement between Iran and six world powers last July has cleared the way for an easing of sanctions. Hafezi said a new round of negotiations is underway with Indian contractors on marketing or delivering Farzad-B natural gas to India. Gas output from the field can either be converted into LNG and shipped to India or transported through a pipeline via Pakistan or subsea. &amp;quot;We can close a deal with Indians if the two sides agree on a contractual model and the method of gas supply or marketing,&amp;quot; Hafezi added. While the field development may cost USD 3 billion, another USD 2 billion would be required for setting up LNG plant. OVL Managing Director Narendra K Verma said the company has not heard anything from Iran. &amp;quot;I have not seen any paper from Iran granting us the development rights. We have to wait for that,&amp;quot; he said. Earlier this year, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh described Farzad-B as the only Iranian project &amp;quot;promised&amp;quot; to a foreign contractor. As a further sign of interest in working with Indians in Farzad-B project, Iran did not list the gas field among the 52 oil and natural gas projects introduced to international companies in a major conference in Tehran last month. OVL in August/September 2010 submitted a revised master development plan (MDP) for producing 60 per cent of the 21.68 trillion cubic feet of in-place gas reserves but had not signed the contract because of threat of being sanctioned by the US which is against any company investing more than USD 20 million in Iran's energy sector in any 12-month period. OVL and IOC hold 40 percent interest each in the block, while the remaining 20 percent is with OIL.","Business, Farzad-B gas field, gas, India, Indian Oil Corporation, Iran, LNG, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Oil India, ONGC Videsh Ltd, Saeed Hafezi","ONGC Videsh Ltd,Farzad-B gas field,Iran,gas,LNG,India,Saeed Hafezi,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Oil India,Indian Oil Corporation",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ovl-close-to-winning-365-bn-farzab-b-gas-field-rights_4496321.html

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) will pay USD 995.26 million for the three discoveries in the KG-OSN-2001/3 block that are under trial production since August 2014. Another USD 200 million will be paid as advance consideration of six other discoveries, for which GSPC has been finalising an investment plan from bringing them to production. &amp;quot;Once the field development plan (FDP), which details the producible gas reserves, is approved by the regulator DGH, we will arrive at a valuation and pay GSPC,&amp;quot; a top ONGC official said. Besides the payout to GSPC, ONGC will have to pay for the entire development cost of the six discoveries which may run into at least a couple of billion dollars. GSPC, which had a debt of Rs 19,716.27 crore as on March 31, 2015, has so far made 9 gas discoveries in the Bay of Bengal block. Of these, three - KG-08, KG-17, KG-15 - commonly known as Deendayal West (DDW) fields - have been approved for development. But against an approved field development plan (FDP) cost of USD 2.75 billion, GSPC seen a huge cost-overrun, incurring USD 2.83 billion as on March 31, 2015. Additionally, it had incurred an exploration cost of USD 584.63 million, taking total expenditure as on March 31, 2015 to USD 3.41 billion. As per the requirement of the FDP, 12 more development wells are yet to be completed which would further escalate the project cost. The trial production from the DDW field commenced in August 2014, but the average production achieved is only 19.45 million standard cubic feet per day against a targeted commercial production of 200 mmscfd. Commercial production has not commenced as production rate has not yet stabilised, the official said. The DGH approved FDP had envisaged commercial production from December 2011. The official said FDP for the six remaining discoveries -- KG-16, KG-22, KG-31, KG-21, KG-19 and KG-20SS, is under review of GSPC. As per the approved FDP of DDW fields, the estimated oil and gas in place (OGIP) was 1.952 trillion cubic feet (tcf) with a projected cumulative production of 1.0596 tcf at a recovery rate of 54.3 per cent. The official said the ONGC board approved the acquisition of Gujarat State Petroleum Corp's (GSPC) entire 80 per cent stake in the block on Friday and an agreement for the same would be set to the Gujarat government owned firm within next few days. &amp;quot;The pact for acquisition will be signed in next week or ten days and we hope to conclude the deal by March end after necessary regulatory approvals from DGH and the government obtained,&amp;quot; he said.","Business, field development plan, GSPC, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,GSPC,field development plan",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-to-pay-over-usd12-bn-for-gspc-stake-buy_8160701.html

Net profit for April-September was at Rs 512 crore, 126.55 percent higher than Rs 226 crore for the same period in the year-ago period, the company said in a statement. OVL, which has projects in 15 countries from Venezuela to New Zealand, reported a 3 percent rise in standalone crude oil production at 1.3 million tonnes. Consolidated crude oil production was up 29 percent at 3.6 million tonnes while gas output was 13 percent higher at 1.87 billion cubic meters. The consolidated oil production was higher due to the acquisition of 15 percent stake in Russia's Vankor oilfield. The net profit was higher despite a 8.5 percent drop in revenue to Rs 3,457 crore. The profit was higher &amp;quot;due to reduced depreciation, depletion and amortisation expenses and forex gains,&amp;quot; the statement said without giving details. OVL is unlisted 100 percent subsidiary of ONGC and by regulation is not required to give out quarterly earning numbers. The company completed acquisition of 15 percent stake in Vankor field in East Siberia in May and subsequently acquired another 11 percent stake from Rosneft Oil Company on October this year. Vankor is Russia's second largest field by production and accounts for 4 percent of Russian output. &amp;quot;The average daily production from the field is around 415,500 barrels per day of crude oil since acquisition and OVL's share of daily oil production from Vankor (considering both the acquisitions) will be about 108,030 barrels a day,&amp;quot; the statement said. OVL said it has signed an agreement with Petroleos De Venezuela SA (PDVSA) for facilitating redevelopment of the San Cristobal joint venture project in Venezuela. &amp;quot;The redevelopment plan aims to increase the current level of production of about 18,000 barrels per day to 27,000 barrels a day by use of water flooding techniques,&amp;quot; the statement said. The agreement also provides for mechanism to liquidate OVL's outstanding dividends from the project and to obtain term finance for the USD 318 million capital investment for implementing the redevelopment plan, it added. OVL owns 40 percent of Venezuela's San Cristobal oilfield and had invested about USD 190 million in the project in 2008. PDVSA holds the remaining stake. It has not been paid for its share of oil from the San Cristobal field in last few years. After this agreement, PDVSA has agreed to supply 17,000 barrels per day of crude oil to repay USD 537 million that it owes to OVL.","Business, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, ONGC Videsh","ONGC Videsh,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-videsh-h1-net-profit-more-than-doubles-to-rs-512-crore_8121221.html

2016-12-11T11:54:10+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,ONGC awaits DGH nod for &amp;amp;#36;5-billion KG-D5 gas development plan,State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp is awaiting nod of upstream regulator DGH to commence investing USD 5.07 billion in bringing to production oil and gas discoveries in its Bay of Bengal block KG-D5.,"State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is awaiting nod of upstream regulator DGH to commence investing USD 5.07 billion in bringing to production oil and gas discoveries in its Bay of Bengal block KG-D5. About a year ago, ONGC submitted to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) a field development plan (FDP) for bringing to production 10 oil and gas discoveries in KG basin block KG-DWN-98/2 (KG-D5), which sits next to Reliance Industries flagging KG-D6 fields. DGH so far has not approved the FDP, an official said. A meeting of the block oversight panel, Management Committee (MC) headed by DGH, has been called next week to review the FDP, he said. &amp;quot;Without waiting for the approval, tendering for long-lead items has started to ensure the 2019- 20 schedule for starting production is not missed,&amp;quot; he said. The board of ONGC had on March 28 approved an investment of USD 5,076.37 million for developing Cluster-II discoveries to flow natural gas from from June 2019 and oil by March 2020. &amp;quot;While the FDP was submitted a year, the board gave investment approval in March after the government allowed higher rates for deepwater discoveries, thus making KG-D5 viable,&amp;quot; he said, adding since then DGH nod is awaited. In 2014, ONGC had announced plans to start gas production from 2018 and oil by 2019 but a final investment decision was made contingent upon government approving a remunerative price for the deepsea block as the current rate of USD 2.5 per million British thermal unit was unviable. The government in March announced a new pricing formula for difficult areas that would at current prices give developers just about USD 6 per mmBtu price. KG-D5 gas fields are viable at that price, he said. The 7,294.6 sq km deepsea KG-D5 block has been broadly categorised into Northern Discovery Area (NDA - 3,800.6 sq km) and Southern Discovery Area (SDA - 3,494 sq km). The NDA has 11 oil and gas discoveries while SDA has the nation's only ultra-deepsea gas find of UD-1. These finds have been clubbed in three groups - Cluster-1, Cluster-II and Cluster-III. Gas discovery in Cluster-I is to be tied up with finds in neighbouring G-4 block for production but this is not being taken up currently because of a dispute with RIL over migration of gas from ONGC blocks, the official said. From Cluster-II a peak oil output of 77,305 barrels per day is envisaged within two years of start of production. Gas output is slated to peak to 16.56 million standard cubic meters per day by end-2021. Cluster-2A mainly comprises of oil finds of A2, P1, M3, M1 and G-2-2 in NDA which can produce 77,305 bpd (3.86 million tonnes per annum) and 3.81 mmscmd of gas. Cluster 2B, which is made up of four gas finds -- R1, U3, U1, and A1 in NDA -- envisages a peak output of 12.75 mmscmd of gas, the official said, adding that peak output is likely to last 7 years. Cluster-3 is the UD-1 gas discovery in SDA in ultra deepsea that poses technological challenges.","Business, DGH, Directorate General of Hydrocarbons, investing, KG-D5, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, PTI",PTI,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-awaits-dgh-nod-for-365-billion-kg-d5-gas-development-plan_8096481.html

It will take around a year to prepare the facility. By 2017, we will roll out the Agartala Basin,&amp;quot; Mahawar said.","State-run energy behemoth ONGC will set up a new 'basin' in Agartala by the end of next year as it looks to focus more on exploration of oil and gas in the North-East region. &amp;quot;We are discussing about setting up a 'basin' in Agartala. Director of Exploration and I visited Agartala around five months ago. We checked the facilities. Currently work for creation of workstation is going on,&amp;quot; ONGC Director (Onshore) Ved Prakash Mahawar told PTI. Construction work is going on as earlier there was no proper building to start functioning of a 'basin' in Agartala, he added. &amp;quot;A 'basin' receives huge amount of data, which are processed subsequently. It will take around a year to prepare the facility. By 2017, we will roll out the Agartala Basin,&amp;quot; Mahawar said. ONGC's North East operations are divided into two areas -- Assam Shelf from Jorhat to Duliajan and Assam Fold Belt from Silchar to Agartala. While exploration is being done only by Assam-Arakan 'basin' based at Jorhat, the production is divided by three 'assets' -- Assam Asset at Nazira, Jorhat Asset at Jorhat and Tripura Asset at Agartala. Basin's job is to discover or explore oil and gas, but it does not produce anything. On the other hand, an 'asset' exploits or produces and sends products to refineries. Explaining the rationale behind creating a new 'basin', the senior official said: &amp;quot;The Assam Fold Belt is a complex and a complicated one. Sometimes we get minerals and other things. We want an experienced person there who knows about it. This will bring in focus to that area. As it is a difficult area, so we want to treat it differently.&amp;quot; Assam Fold Belt has mainly gas, while there are both oil and gas in Assam Shelf, he added. Mahawar said the new 'basin' is being created to focus more on exploration of energy sources in the area. When asked about the manpower in the upcoming Agartala 'basin', he said: &amp;quot;In a basin, mostly scientists are there. In Jorhat 'basin', 300 people are there. So usually, around 200- 300 people are there in a 'basin'. But Agartala will house 50 -60 people only as finance, HR and few other departments in Jorhat will be shared with it.&amp;quot; Before creating an 'asset' in Jorhat, it was only a 'basin' with a daily production of 350 tonnes. &amp;quot;Now we have made an 'asset' in Jorhat to focus on the production. An Executive Director sits there. As soon as it was made an 'asset', production has gone up to 400 tons every day. This will increase to 500 tonnes per day next year,&amp;quot; Mahawar said. In last fiscal, ONGC production in Assam was 0.9 million tonnes and this year, it is targetted to reach the figure of one million tonnes.","Agartala, Business, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Agartala",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-to-roll-out-new-basinagartala-by-2017_8096421.html

Rosneft and its partners had in October signed an all-cash deal to acquire Essar Oil at an enterprise value of about USD 13 billion. While the Russian firm Rosneft bought a 49 per cent stake in Essar Oil's refinery, port and petrol pumps, Netherlands-based Trafigura Group Pte, one of the biggest commodity trading companies in the world, and Russian investment fund United Capital Partners split another 49 per cent equity equally. The remaining 2 per cent will be held by minority shareholders after delisting of Essar Oil. The deal has an enterprise value of close to USD 12.9 billion- USD 10.9 billion being for a 20 million tonnes a year refinery in Gujarat and over 2,700 petrol pumps and another USD 2 billion for Vadinar port in Gujarat. The deal factors in Essar Oil's debt is of about USD 4.5 billion and about USD 2 billion debt with the port company. Also, the nearly USD 3 billion dues to Iran for past oil purchases will continue to be on Essar Oil books. The 49 per cent stake Trafigura and UCP are picking will be split between the two in 49:49 ratio while the Essar Group will hold the remaining 2 per cent. Balgarnie said Rosneft's relationship with India has two aspects. &amp;quot;Recently, Indian oil companies like Indian Oil Corp, Oil India Ltd and ONGC had acquired stakes in our Vankor and Tass-Yuryakh oilfields. Now, we are also closing in on the acquisition of Vadinar refinery,&amp;quot; he added. The acquisition is the biggest in India and largest outbound deal for Russia. The all cash deal was expected to close in first quarter of 2017. Rosneft is on the list of companies sanctioned by the US for Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. Essar Oil would have come on that list if Rosneft would have picked up 51 per cent stake.

2016-12-06T10:00:02+05:30,ONGC,Faizan Javed,Sudan holds up OVL oil field licence extension,"The licence for Block 2B expired last week and an automatic 5-year extension is available, but Sudan, whose revenues have been hit with a drop in oil prices, wants higher taxes and royalties before it agrees to the same, officials said.","Sudan is holding up extension to ONGC Videsh's licence over an oil field as the government seeks higher royalties, tax and profit petroleum even as it delays paying nearly USD 300 million in oil dues. The licence for Block 2B expired last week and an automatic 5-year extension is available, but Sudan, whose revenues have been hit with a drop in oil prices, wants higher taxes and royalties before it agrees to the same, officials said. OVL, the overseas arm of the state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), in 2003 had bought a 25 percent stake in Greater Nile Oil Project (GNOP) comprising Block 1, 2 and 4 in the undivided Sudan. It lies in the prolific Muglad basin, about 780 kms in the South-West of Khartoum, the capital of Sudan. The project produces about 50,000 barrels of oil per day. Upon secession of South Sudan from Sudan in July 2011, the contract areas of blocks 1, 2 and 4, spread over both areas, were split with a major share of production and reserves now situated in South Sudan. Blocks 2A, 2B and 4N are in Sudan, and blocks 1A, 1B as well as 4S are in South Sudan. Block 2B produces 50,000 bpd of oil while Block 4 is in the exploration phase. The official said OVL and its partners China National Petroleum Company (40 percent stake), Petronas of Malaysia (30 percent) and Sudapet (5 percent) want a 5-15 year extension, but Sudan is yet to agree. Sudan has not paid OVL for the oil from GNOP it consumed. Post secession, as the Sudanese government's share of total production in Sudan was not sufficient to meet requirements of local refineries, foreign firms were asked to sell their share of crude oil to it. However, the payment of dues on account of crude oil purchased by the Sudanese government has not been received, he said, adding that OVL's share of the outstanding dues is about USD 300 million. The crude oil produced from oil field of GNOP is transported through a 1,504-km pipeline to Port Sudan on the Red Sea. OVL, along with state-owned Oil India, had constructed and financed a 741-km multi-product pipeline from Khartoum refinery to Port Sudan for USD 194 million. OVL's share of project cost was 90 percent while the rest was borne by OIL. The pipeline was handed over to the Sudanese government in October 2005. The lumpsum price together with lease rent was to be given to OVL in 18 equal half-yearly instalments, effective December 2005. While the payment of 11 half-yearly instalments due till December 2010 was received from the government, the remaining seven instalments due from June 30, 2011 to June 30, 2014, are yet to be released. OVL, whose share of investment in the project was USD 158.01 million, has been following up for realisation of USD 98.94 million from the Sudanese government at various levels, he added.","Business, oil, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, petroleum, Sudan, Tax","Sudan,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,oil,oil,tax,petroleum,oil",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sudan-holdsovl-oil-field-licence-extension_8070021.html
2016-12-06T09:16:02+05:30,ONGC,Faizan Javed,HPCL's Barmer refinery project stares at cost overrun,"HPCL, in March 2013, had signed an MoU with the Rajasthan government for setting up the refinery-cum-petrochemical complex in the Thar desert near the oil discoveries made by Cairn India.","Hindustan Petroleum Corporation's 9-million tonne (mt) a year Barmer refinery in Rajasthan, which has been in the works for over four years now, will cost Rs 41,000-42,000 crore, up from the previous estimate of Rs 37,320 crore. HPCL, in March 2013, had signed an MoU with the Rajasthan government for setting up the refinery-cum-petrochemical complex in the Thar desert near the oil discoveries made by Cairn India. But the refinery never took off as a change of guard in the state led to Rajasthan government putting on hold the fiscal incentives for the project. &amp;quot;We are talking to the state government explaining to them the reconfiguration of the unit,&amp;quot; HPCL Director (Refineries) Vinod S Shenoy told PTI here. While the size of the refinery remains the same, the unit will cost more because it now has to be built to produce Euro-VI grade petrol and diesel, he said. &amp;quot;The project will cost more than the earlier estimate of Rs 37,000 crore,&amp;quot; he said, adding that Engineers India Ltd (EIL) has been asked to do a feasibility study. While stating that the cost numbers have not yet been worked out, he said the project may need Rs 4,000-5,000 crore more. Shenoy said the discussions with the Rajasthan government have not reached the stage of negotiating the exact fiscal concessions that the company would need to set up the project. The HPCL board, in March 2013, had approved setting up of the complex at a cost of Rs 37,320 crore. Half of the crude oil requirement at the proposed refinery at Barmer was to come from the neighbouring oil fields of Cairn India. The rest was to be imported crude. At that point, HPCL had asked the state government to extend fiscal benefits like the ones extended by Gujarat and Odisha to new refinery projects to make the Barmer unit viable. The concessions included 50 per cent exemption in excise duty and the state government picking a small stake in the project. Originally, the state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), which owns 30 per cent interest in the Barmer oil fields of Cairn India, in 2005 had committed to building the refinery, but later started soft-pedaling the project. In 2012, HPCL entered the fray and proposed to take 51 per cent stake in the same. ONGC, which originally had the authorisation from the government for processing the Barmer crude at the proposed refinery, willingly made way for HPCL. Cairn India, which holds 70 per cent interest in the fields, currently produces about 1,65,000 barrels per day oil (8 million tonnes a year) from the Rajasthan fields. There may be possibility of Vedanta, which in 2011 acquired Cairn India for USD 8.67 billion, taking a small equity of 2-3 per cent in the project. Sources said the Rajasthan government in 2013 had started the process of land acquisition of about 926 hectares, but it was put on hold. For HPCL, which has only two refineries in Mumbai and Visakhapatnam, the project would have helped meet fuel demand in the north.","Barmer refinery, Business, crude, Engineers India, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, petrochemical complex, Rajasthan","Hindustan Petroleum Corporation,Barmer refinery,Rajasthan,petrochemical complex,Engineers India,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,crude",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/hpcls-barmer-refinery-project-stares-at-cost-overrun_8069681.html

The company is also looking at scaling up its petrochemical production capacity to clock larger margins, MRPL Managing Director H Kumar told PTI here. &amp;quot;We have asked Engineers India Ltd (EIL) to do a feasibility study for expansion of our refining capacity from the present 15 million tonnes (mt). Previously, we were targeting 21 mt, but now, we are exploring if 25 mt can be done,&amp;quot; he said. MRPL, a subsidiary of the state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), is ready to produce Euro-VI fuel and the planned expansion is part of its Vision 2022 with a target of Rs 5,000 crore net profit and local sales of 5 mt. It had reported a net profit of Rs 1,148.16 crore on a turnover of Rs 39,647.44 crore in 2015-16. &amp;quot;The expansion is subject to availability of land. A 1,050 acres of land parcel adjacent to our refinery has been identified and the acquisition process will now start,&amp;quot; he said. According to Kumar, EIL will study if the crude distillation unit (CDU) of 6 mt or 10 mt should be set up. &amp;quot;We would prefer 10 mt. Going by the thumb rule of Rs 1,100 crore per tonne, the expansion would cost Rs 11,000 crore,&amp;quot; he said. The expansion is seen as a major margin driver, potentially doubling the company's profit per barrel. It is expected to help the company process cheaper, heavier crudes into high-value products like diesel, liquefied petroleum gas and propylene.","Business, diesel, Engineers India, invest, Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation","Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals,invest,Engineers India,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,diesel",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/mrpl-readies-rs-11000-cr-to-hit-25-mt-refining-capacity_8065241.html
2016-12-05T12:52:05+05:30,ONGC,Faizan Javed,ONGC to begin oil production from Ratna R-Series field in 2019,"The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had in March decided to return the fields to its original licensee after contract with Essar could not be concluded even after 20 years.","State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) will in 2019 begin producing oil from the Ratna and R-Series oilfield in Mumbai offshore, which it won back after the government cancelled award to Essar Oil. &amp;quot;We are working on a development plan and investment approvals will be sought in a month's time,&amp;quot; ONGC Director (Offshore) Tapas Kumar Sengupta told PTI here. Production form the fields is targeted to start in 2019 with an output of 10,000 barrels per day initially, he said. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had in March decided to return the fields to its original licensee after contract with Essar could not be concluded even after 20 years. Essar Oil and Premier Oil of UK were awarded the Ratna and R-Series oil and gas fields, lying 130 km off the Mumbai coast, in December 1996 but the production sharing contract (PSC) could not be signed due to differences of rates of royalty and other issues. &amp;quot;We have taken over the fields and have started the process of developing them,&amp;quot; he said. The Ratna and R-series oil fields hold an estimated 87 million barrels of oil and 1.2 billion cubic metres of gas reserves. The medium-sized Ratna and R-Series (R&amp;amp;amp;RS) fields have been languishing since 1993 when the then P V Narasimha Rao-led Congress government decided to invite bids. The fields were awarded to a consortium led by Essar Oil in 1996. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) in 1999 approved finalising and concluding PSC within six months after negotiations were held by the negotiating team of secretaries (NTS), but the same has not been signed till date over royalty and cess amount to be charged from Essar Oil and partners. NTS held 20 meetings between November 1999 and June 2013 and kept setting targets for completion of negotiations and signing of production sharing contract, but it could not stick to its own targets for completion of the negotiations. ONGC had discovered the fields and created facilities in Ratna R-12, which is part of R&amp;amp;amp;RS, at a cost of Rs 472.55 crore. These facilities were used by the company for production since 1983 before production was stopped in September 1994 after the field was put up for auction, he said. These facilities have been deteriorating as a result of 'plundering and looting' of platform utilities and equipment. The estimated repair cost for the existing facilities would be Rs 1,085.70 crore. &amp;quot;We have to build the infrastructure afresh,&amp;quot; Sengupta said. The fields have been reverted to ONGC subject to payment of cess and royalty at the current rates.","Business, CCEA, Essar Oil, government, Narendra Modi, oil, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Prime Minister, Ratna and R-Series oilfield","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,oil,Ratna and R-Series oilfield,Essar Oil,government,CCEA,Narendra Modi,Prime Minister",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-to-begin-oil-productionratna-r-series-field2019_8064581.html

The state-owned firms had initially indicated that they will bid for the fields, which were said to have been &amp;quot;surrendered&amp;quot; by them as they were commercially unviable under the price control regime. But new liberal fiscal terms had made these viable and the PSUs wanted to get them back. The two however had not offered any bids by the time the round closed for the day and the reason offered was that since they had originally surrendered them, it did not make any sense to bid for these fields. Sources said as many as 42 bids were received for 34 out of the 46 fields on offer, with Cairn India and Hindustan Oil Exploration Co (HOEC) being the major bidders alongside five smaller foreign firms. BP plc, the biggest foreign investor in the oil and gas sector in India, as also Reliance Industries did not bid in the round that was also skipped by global energy giants like Exxon Mobil and Chevron. Magna Energy too, the firm floated by maverick oil explorer Mike Watts who gave India its largest oilfield in Rajasthan, did not bid even though it was betting big on the country. While Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan travelled the globe - from Singapore to Houston - to get investors for the first oil field auction round in over four years, big giants sat out primarily due to small size of acreage being offered and the overheads required to bring them to production. Launching the auction round in May, Pradhan had stated that Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) would be able to bid for the fields on offer. But the two firms were reportedly asked not to bid as private and foreign investors thought they would not be able to compete with the might of state-owned firms with inside knowledge of the fields.

Of these, 26 are on-land, 18 shallow water and 2 deepwater fields. The fields hold an in-place reserves of 48 million tonnes of oil and over 38 billion cubic metres of gas reserves, worth Rs 70,000 crore at current prices. Sources said the government took away these discoveries from ONGC as it could not develop them because of small size and unviable price.

Financially strained Niko had in February last year announced plans to sell its 10 per cent stake in the KG-DWN- 98/3 or KG-D6 block to pay off USD 340 million debt. It had planned to sell off the interest by April 30, 2015 but later extended it to May 31 and then to September 15, 2015. It called the sale off apparently because it could not find a buyer. The firm's interim Chief Executive Robert Ellsworth said the company had &amp;quot;re-launched the sales process for our interest in the D6 Block&amp;quot; due to &amp;quot;favourable developments with respect to natural gas pricing applicable to the company's undeveloped deep water fields&amp;quot;. While gas from existing producing fields are priced at rate equivalent to price prevailing in gas surplus economies like Russia, US and Canada, the government has given a pricing freedom subject to a cap for undeveloped gas finds in deep-sea blocks. KG-D6 has several undeveloped gas discoveries. &amp;quot;As previously communicated to shareholders, the company is in the midst of a strategic plan to enhance the value of our core assets with the objective of ultimately monetising these assets for the benefit of the company's stakeholders,&amp;quot; he said in the earnings statement for the quarter ended September 30. RIL is the operator of KG-D6 block with a 60 per cent interest, while BP plc of UK owns 30 per cent stake. Ellsworth said Niko believes the KG-D6 block offers &amp;quot;a number of compelling attributes to potential bidders&amp;quot; but the sale &amp;quot;will inevitably be complicated&amp;quot; by the USD 1.55 billion claim made by the government against the three firms in respect of gas reckoned to have migrated from neighbouring blocks of ONGC into D6. &amp;quot;While we believe the D6 Block offers a number of compelling attributes to potential bidders, the sales process will inevitably be complicated by the recent claim made by the Government of India against the contractor group of the D6 production sharing contract in respect of gas said to have migrated from neighbouring blocks to the D6 Block,&amp;quot; he said. Niko, he said, believes the contractor group is not liable for the amount claimed and &amp;quot;is working with the contractor group to defend against the claim by invoking the dispute resolution mechanism in the D6 Block production sharing contract.&amp;quot; RIL says the government's claim was based on misreading and misinterpretation of key elements of the production sharing contract and is without precedent in the oil and gas industry, anywhere in the world. &amp;quot;The liability of the contractor has not been established by any process known to law and the quantification of the purported claim is without any basis and arbitrary,&amp;quot; it had stated after the government slapped a USD 1.55 billion demand notice for &amp;quot;unfairly enriching&amp;quot; by producing ONGC's share of gas.Disclosure: Reliance Industries, which owns Network18, also publishes Moneycontrol.com.","Business, KG-D6, Niko Resources, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Reliance Industries, Robert Ellsworth","Reliance Industries,Niko Resources,KG-D6,Robert Ellsworth,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/rils-partner-niko-puts-kg-d6-stake-for-sale_7959841.html

State-run Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) holds the remaining stake.","ONGC Videsh will provide USD 318 million financing to help raise output at a Venezuelan oilfield after the Latin American nation signed pact to supply 17,000 barrels per day of crude oil to India to clear past dues. OVL, the overseas arm of state-owned ONGC, owns 40 percent of Venezuela's San Cristobal oilfield and had invested about USD 190 million in the project in 2008. State-run Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) holds the remaining stake. &amp;quot;We will stand guarantee to raising of the USD 318 million capital required for investing in the San Cristobal project,&amp;quot; OVL CEO and Managing Director Narendra K Verma said. OVL and Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA signed the deal on Friday to finance increased crude production at the joint venture Petrolera Indovenezolana, SA, which operates the San Cristobal oilfield. The financing will help boost production at San Cristobal field to 30,000-35,000 bpd from current 19,000-20,000 bpd, he said. Verma said PDVSA has agreed to supply 17,000 bpd of crude oil till repay USD 537 million it owes to OVL. &amp;quot;The crude oil will be supplied till such time that the dues are fully cleared,&amp;quot; he said. OVL has not been paid for its share of oil from the San Cristobal field in last few years. San Cristobal project covers an area of 160.18 square kilometers in the Zuata Subdivision of proliferous Orinoco Heavy Oil belt in Venezuela. The field output is down from a peak of 38,000 bpd. OVL had received its dividend from sale of crude oil produced from the field totaling USD 56.224 million for 2008. But dividends for 2009 to 2013 totalling USD 537.631 million remained unpaid due to cash flow difficulties being faced by PDVSA. &amp;quot;What we have signed is basically a very good deal. It will help raise production as well as clear our outstanding,&amp;quot; said Verma, who was in Caracus for the signing of the deal last week. During 2015-16, OVL's share of crude oil production was 0.585 million tonnes as compared to 0.645 million tonnes during the previous fiscal. It's share of investment in the project was Rs 2,599.71 crore (USD 486.69 million) till March 31, 2016. Venezuela, the cash-strapped OPEC member and holder of the world's biggest oil reserves, has been unable to pay foreign partners on some of its projects as revenues slumped along with crude prices and as funds were diverted to social programme and fuel subsidies. The Latin American nation earns almost all of its export revenues from oil. It is already repaying loans outstanding to China with crude and OVL was keen on a similar deal. Venezuela is India's fourth largest source of crude oil, supplying some 23.6 million tonnes or 12 percent of the country's annual import in 2015-16. OVL, along with Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Oil India Ltd, also holds 18 percent stake in Venezuela's Carabobo-1 project, which currently produces about 16,000 bpd of oil and is expected to reach 90,000 bpd by end of 2017.","Business, crude, Indian Oil Corporation, loans, Narendra K Verma, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Oil India, ONGC Videsh, Venezuelan oilfield","ONGC Videsh,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Venezuelan oilfield,Narendra K Verma,loans,crude,Indian Oil Corporation,Oil India",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ovl-to-provide-36318-mn-financing-guarantee-to-venezuela_7914701.html

After deducting USD 71.71 million royalty paid on the gas produced and adding an interest at the rate of Libor plus 2 per cent totaling USD 149.86 million, a total demand of USD 1.55 billion was made on RIL, BP and Niko.

The government had appointed a one-man committee under retired Justice A P Shah to go into the issue. The panel in its report on August 29 felt that the government and not ONGC is entitled to compensation. Subsequently, the ministry asked its upstream technical arm DGH to calculate the amount of compensation and a demand notice has now been slapped on RIL-BP-Niko. &amp;quot;The committee has concluded that the contractor's (RIL- BP-Niko) production of migrated gas and retention of ensuing benefits amounts to unjust enrichment, since the production sharing contract (PSC)... does not permit a contractor to produce and sell migrated gas,&amp;quot; the demand note said.

The notice also sought USD 177 million in profit petroleum from the partners after the government disallowed certain costs previously for KG-D6 output not matching targets. Since both the ministry as well as the Shah panel had cited provisions of the signed PSC between the patners and the government, the issue may be headed for arbitration. RIL contests that it had knowingly produced any gas belonging to ONGC as all the wells it drilled were within the boundary walls of KG-D6 block and with explicit permission of the government. While RIL and partners are likely to contest the compensation claim, arbitration is likely to be resorted to as that is the dispute resolution mechanism set out under PSC for settling any differences between the government and a private contractor. The cost disallowance issue is already under arbitration. RIL did not offer any immediate comments but a BP spokesperson said: &amp;quot;We have received a letter from the government on the issue of migration of gas from the neighboring block.

As a rule, service tax is paid by the entity providing the service, but in certain cases it is the liability of the party that receives the service to remit the levy under a system called reverse charge. &amp;amp;nbsp; In the circular clarifying on service tax liability on use of wireless spectrum, CBEC stated that all periodic payments such as royalty on use of natural resources will attract 15 percent service tax. &amp;amp;nbsp; Following the clarification, the Service Tax department has sent letters to companies like Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), Cairn India Ltd and Reliance Industries seeking information on royalty payments, industry sources said. &amp;amp;nbsp; These companies had paid a total of Rs 4,885 crore royalty on oil and gas produced in 2015-16 to the Centre and another Rs 7,932 crore to states. Considering change in prices and production profile, the service tax liability would come to over Rs 1,922 crore this fiscal on top of the royalty payout. &amp;amp;nbsp; CBEC is using the logic that since service tax is leviable on wireless spectrum, which is a natural resources, the same should extend to oil and gas as well. &amp;amp;nbsp; Sources said energy explorers through their association have taken up the matte with the Oil Ministry saying their profitability has been severely impacted by slump in oil and gas prices to multi-year low and the additional levy would erode it further. &amp;amp;nbsp; CBEC in the circular stated that one-time payments for natural resources are exempt from service tax but not any periodic payments. Oil companies have to pay royalty on a monthly basis. &amp;amp;nbsp; Exemption from payment of service tax is applicable only to &amp;amp;ldquo;one time charge, payable in full upfront or in installments, for assignment of right to use anynatural resource and not to any periodic payment required to be made&amp;amp;rdquo; such as Spectrum User Charges, license fee in respect of spectrum, or monthlypayments with respect to the coal extracted from the coal mine or royalty payable on extracted coal and natural resources, CBEC said.","Business, Cairn India, CBEC, government, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Cairn India,government,CBEC",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-cairn-face-rs-1922-cr-service-taxroyalty-payments_7888981.html

The company signed a deal with Rosneft Oil Company to acquire additional 11 per cent stake in the East Siberian field for USD 930 million on October 28. &amp;quot;We raised a bridge loan of USD 930 million from overseas lenders to pay for the acquisition cost of 11 per cent stake,&amp;quot; OVL CEO and Managing Director Narendra K Verma said here.

2016-10-24T16:12:03+05:30,ONGC,Faizan Javed,ONGC to discuss bonus issue on Thursday to up liquidity,"With all of its about Rs 14,000 crore cash committed in future projects and capital expenditure, the company is considering issuing bonus shares rather than cash dividends as a method of providing income to shareholders.","The board of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will on Thursday consider issuing a bonus share to increase liquidity ahead of government disinvestment. With all of its about Rs 14,000 crore cash committed in future projects and capital expenditure, the company is considering issuing bonus shares rather than cash dividends as a method of providing income to shareholders. The board on October 27 will consider the second quarter financial results as also &amp;quot;consider a proposal for declaration of bonus issue&amp;quot;, the company said in a regulatory filing. Issuing bonus shares increases the issued share capital of the company, which is then perceived as being bigger than it really is, making it more attractive to investors. When a company issues bonus shares, the price of its existing shares comes down by about the same ratio as the bonus shares that have been issued. So, if the bonus issue is 1:1, which means they are issuing one additional share for each existing share, the market price of the share will roughly halve. ONGC had in December 2010 issued 1:1 bonus share along with a special dividend of Rs 32 per share and a stock split. At that point, ONGC equity share of Rs 10 face value was split into two of Rs 5 face value. This was done as a precursor to the company's planned follow-on public offer (FPO) in the following year. The government is considering divesting at least 5 percent of its shares through an FPO this fiscal to raise about Rs 12,500 crore. Prior to that, the company had in 2006 issued a 1:2 bonus issue. The government holds 68.93 percent stake in ONGC, the nation's biggest oil and gas explorer and the most profitable public sector unit. The ONGC stock closed up 4.6 percent at Rs 292.90 on BSE today.","Business, disinvestment, government, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, ONGC","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,ONGC,disinvestment,government",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-to-discuss-bonus-issuethursday-toliquidity_7818121.html

OIL, Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Bharat PetroResources Ltd (a unit of Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd or BPCL) is looking at buying a stake in Suzunskoye, Tagulskoye and Lodochnoye fields - collectively known as Vankor Culster, sources privy to the development said. ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), is also interested in the fields. Rosneft, Russia's national oil company that owns the fields, wants to retain a majority stake and is keen to sell only up to 49 percent stake. In case OVL is accommodated, the entire 49 percent stake would have to be split between the Indian companies. OVL may possibly take 26 percent in proportion of the stake it bought in the main Vankor oilfield. OIL-IOC-BPRL may take 23.9 percent stake in line with its holding in the main Vankor field. Vankorneft, a subsidiary of Rosneft, is developing the Vankor oil and gas condensate field, situated in the northern part of Eastern Siberia. In 2013, Vankorneft was chosen as an operator on development of new fields of Vankor cluster - Suzunskoye, Tagulskoye and Lodochnoye fields, located close to the Vankor field. The reserves of Suzunskoye field exceed 56 million tonnes of oil and condensate, and 35 billion cubic meters of gas. OVL in May completed acquisition of 15 percent stake in Russia's second biggest oilfield of Vankor for USD 1.268 billion. It last week got government nod to raise the stake by a further 11 percent at an investment of USD 930 million. The 26 percent stake would give OVL 7.31 million tons of oil. The consortium of OIL-IOC-BPRL acquired 23.9 percent stake in the field at a cost of USD 2.02 billion, giving them 6.56 million tons of oil. Rosneft continues to hold the remaining 50.1 percent shares of JSC Vankorneft. The field has recoverable reserves of 2.5 billion barrels. Besides, the OIL-IOC-BPRL consortium has taken another 29.9 percent stake in a separate Taas-Yuryakh oilfield in East Siberia for USD 1.12 billion. The investments have taken the total investment in Russia this year to USD 5.46 billion. These investments will give India 15.18 million tons of oil equivalent. The investment made compares to USD 28.48 billion investment by Indian companies overseas in the past 50 years, giving it about 10 million tons of oil equivalent. While Vankor produces about 442,000 barrels of oil per day (4 percent of Russian crude oil production), Taas currently produces about 21,000 barrels per day of oil, and a peak of 1,00,000 bpd is expected by 2021.","Arctic region, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, Bharat PetroResources, Business, Indian Oil Corporation, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Oil India, oilfields, ONGC Videsh Ltd, Rosneft, Russia, Suzunskoye","Oil India,Russia,oilfields,Arctic region,Indian Oil Corporation,Bharat PetroResources,Bharat Petroleum Corporation,Suzunskoye,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,ONGC Videsh Ltd,Rosneft",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/indian-consortium-eyes-stakerussian-arctic-oilfield_7612721.html
2016-10-11T11:28:02+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,Oil field auction date may be extended,"There are apprehensions about the response after prospective bidders complained about the quality and amount of data being made available on the fields that have been put on offer, sources privy to the development said.","Fearing poor response, the government is likely to extend by at least one month the last date of bidding for the auction of 46 small oil and gas fields that were &amp;quot;given-up&amp;quot; by state-owned ONGC and Oil India. Bidding for the auction, the first in over four years, is to close on October 31. There are apprehensions about the response after prospective bidders complained about the quality and amount of data being made available on the fields that have been put on offer, sources privy to the development said. For bidders to make decisions, more data particularly about size of reserves is required and making that available would require extending the deadline, they said. Also, some prospective bidders have raised concerns about the size of the blocks or fields on offer. They says 10 square kilometer offering, one-tenth of the smallest block ever offered in the previous bid rounds, was too small. Sources said the bidders feel the block area has to be larger to give them room for probing for oil and gas reserves. After holding roadshows in India and abroad, the Oil Ministry's technical arm, the DGH will on October 19 hold an &amp;quot;outreach&amp;quot; even on the Discovered Small Fields Bid Round 2016 in national capital. A 'Bidder Facilitation Workshop' is planned at the event to &amp;quot;resolve queries of the bidders&amp;quot;, they said adding the extension of the bid deadline may be announced there. The auction, which was announced on May 25, is to be conducted on simpler contractual terms together with pricing and marketing freedom. India liberalised its exploration and production regime almost two decades ago when in early 1990s it auctioned about 28 fields to private and public investors. In late 1990s, it further liberalised its E&amp;amp;amp;P sector with the introduction of New Exploration Licensing Regime (NELP) regime that allowed 100 per cent FDI and offered a level playing field to private and national oil companies. NELP was based on Production Sharing Contract (PSC) that meant sharing of revenues with government post recovery of cost by contractor. This regime was marred by disputes over cost recovery and regulatory inflexibility. Now the bid round is being held under a new regime that will offer discovered fields to those who offering the maximum share of oil and gas to the government. The fields on offer hold an estimated 625 million barrels of in-place oil and gas reserves. Sources said the 46 fields that are offered are actually 67 small and marginal discoveries that have been clubbed. Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) &amp;quot;surrendered&amp;quot; these as they could not develop them because of huge overhead cost and uneconomic size. Last exploration licensing round concluded in March 2012. That was the Ninth round of bidding under NELP. A total of 256 block were awarded in the nine rounds of NELP.

The consortium had in June signed agreement to buy another 23.9 percent in JSC Vankorneft, a subsidiary of Rosneft, which holds two licences for the Vankor oil fields in East Siberia valid till 2112. The deals closed. Officials said the Vankor asset has been valued at USD 8.45 billion as on May 31, 2015 on zero debt and working capital basis for arriving at the acquisition price. This is the same value at which ONGC Videsh, the overseas arm of the state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), bought 15 percent stake in Vankor in December 2015.

OVL, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), had in May this year completed acquisition of 15 percent stake in Vankor oil field for USD 1.28 billion. &amp;quot;The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has given its approval to an acquisition by OVL for 11 percent stake in JSC Vankorneft from Rosneft Oil Company (Rosneft), the national oil company of Russian Federation (Russia),&amp;quot; an official statement said here. Rosneft operates Vankor fields through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Vankorneft. &amp;quot;OVL will be paying an amount of USD 930 million for acquiring 11 percent stake in Vankorneft,&amp;quot; it said. The acquisition of stake in Vankorneft will provide 3.2 million tonnes of oil equivalent to OVL by 2017. It will also provide an opportunity to Indian public sector oil and gas companies to acquire new technologies from Rosneft. &amp;quot;The acquisition is in line with the ONGC's stated objective of adding high quality international assets to India's exploration and production (E&amp;amp;amp;P) portfolio and thereby augmenting India's energy security,&amp;quot; the statement said. Besides OVL's 26 percent stake in Vankor, a consortium comprising Oil India (OIL), Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Bharat PetroResources (BPRL) acquired 23.9 percent stake in Vankorneft at a cost of USD 2.02 billion, which will give them 6.56 mt of oil. OVL's previous 15 percent stake buy in Vankor had given it 4.11 mt per annum of oil.","Bharat PetroResources, Business, Indian Oil Corporation, Narendra Modi, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Oil India, ONGC Videsh, OVL, Prime Minister, Union Cabinet, Vankorneft","Union Cabinet,ONGC Videsh,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,OVL,Narendra Modi,Prime Minister,Indian Oil Corporation,Oil India,Bharat PetroResources,Vankorneft",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-videshs-additional-11-vankor-stake-buy-gets-cabinet-nod_7576281.html

2016-10-02T19:22:23+05:30,ONGC,Nazim Khan,"ONGC, OIL making losses on natural gas production",State-owned ONGC and Oil India are making losses on natural gas production after government cut rates for the fourth consecutive time to bring down selling price to below the cost of production.,"State-owned ONGC and Oil India are making losses on natural gas production after government cut rates for the fourth consecutive time to bring down selling price to below the cost of production.Price of natural gas produced by Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), OIL and Reliance Industries locally was cut by 18 per cent to USD 2.5 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) based on its gross heat value for six month period beginning October 1.On net heat value basis, the price will be USD 2.78.&amp;quot;Our average cost of production is about USD 5.14 per mmBtu. It comes to about USD 3.59 per mmBtu without taking into account return on capital,&amp;quot; said a senior ONGC official.For Oil India Ltd, the cost of production, without taking into account the return on capital, comes to about USD 3.06.&amp;quot;Gas production is now a loss making business as irrespective of cost of production we have to continue paying royalty and other taxes,&amp;quot; the official said.As per a new mechanism approved by the government in October 2014, the price of domestically produced natural gas is to be revised every six months -- April 1 and October 1 -- using weighted average or rates prevalent in gas-surplus economies of US/Mexico, Canada and Russia.For October 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017, the rate was on Friday announced to be USD 2.5 per mmBtu compared to USD 3.06 per mmBtu previously. The price of gas between October 1, 2015 and March 31, 2016 was USD 3.81 per mmBtu and USD 4.66 in the prior six month period.Next change is due on April 1.The reduction in natural gas prices would mean lower raw material cost for compressed natural gas (CNG) and natural gas piped to households (PNG) and would translate into reduction in retail prices. It would also mean lower feedstock cost for power generation and manufacturing of fertilisers.But for producers, it means lower revenue. Every dollar dip in gas price results in Rs 4,000 crore hit in revenue of ONGC on an annual basis. The current price reduction would hit its revenue by about Rs 1,000 crore.Alongside the price cut, the government also announced a sharp reduction in cap price based on alternate fuels for undeveloped gas finds in difficult areas like deepsea which are unviable to develop as per the existing pricing formula.The cap for October 1, 2016 top March 31, 2017 will be USD 5.3 per mmBtu, down from USD 6.61 in April 1 to September 30 period.The official said ONGC had used this flexibility to sell about 1.4 million standard cubic meters per day of gas from a Mumbai offshore field.&amp;quot;We sold the gas at USD 5.05 per mmBtu to (state gas utility) GAIL India Ltd. Fortunately, that price remains under the lower cap,&amp;quot; he said.Indian gas prices are calculated by taking weighted average price at Henry Hub of the US, National Balancing Point of the UK, rates in Alberta (Canada) and Russia with a lag of one quarter.So, the rates for October 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017 period were based on average price at the international hubs during July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016.","Business, cost of production, loss, natural gas, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Oil India, price","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Oil India,natural gas,cost of production,loss,price",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-oil-making-lossesnatural-gas-production_7558481.html

2016-09-27T16:00:11+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,ONGC board vertically split on claiming gas compensation,"The Board of ONGC is split on the issue of claiming compensation for Rs 11,000 crore worth of natural gas spewing from its KG basin block into adjoining fields of Reliance Industries.","The Board of ONGC is split on the issue of claiming compensation for Rs 11,000 crore worth of natural gas spewing from its KG basin block into adjoining fields of Reliance Industries. Justice A P Shah Committee on the issue of gas migrating from idling ONGC blocks to RIL's producing gas fields, last month opined that the compensation for &amp;quot;unjust enrichment&amp;quot; by the Mukesh Ambani-run firm should go to the government and not the state-owned firm. It was of the opinion that the gas belongs to the government and so it alone deserves to be compensated. While ONGC had in May 2014 not hesitated from filing a case against RIL in the Delhi High Court and making the government a party to it, it is now vertically split on the issue. Sources said the section of the board which was responsible for the company in the first place taking up the issue of RIL producing ONGC's gas wants the company to strongly contest the Shah committee recommendation. It feels that the Delhi High Court had given the company an option of approaching the court again if it is unsatisfied with any part of the dispute resolution. And so the company should approach the High Court again, they feel. The other section however feels it is not wise to fight with the government and the company having proved its point that gas did indeed migrate to RIL fields, should accept the recommendations, they said. But the former group however feels the premise on which Shah committee has based its recommendation was flawed as by the logic even RIL is not an owner of the gas in its KG-D6 block and it should just be paid a fixed rate of return on investment and not be given pricing and marketing freedom. The Oil Ministry has asked its technical arm DGH to quantify the amount of compensation that RIL has to pay. The Shah Committee stated, &amp;quot;The Government of India, and not ONGC, is entitled to claim restitution from RIL for the unjust benefit it received and unfairly retained. ONGC has no locus standi to bring a tortuous claim against RIL for trespass/conversion since it does not have any ownership rights or possessory interest in the natural gas.&amp;quot; The Shah Committee in its report noted and accepted the independent consultant D&amp;amp;amp;M Report findings that connectivity between the reservoirs in KG-DWN-98/3 (or KG-D6) block of RIL and ONGC's KG-DWN-98/2 and Godavari PML blocks is established. Since April 1, 2009, when RIL began production from KG- D6, to March 31, 2015, 7.009 and 4.116 billion cubic meters of gas had migrated from Godavari PML and D1 discovery of KG- DWN-98/2 block respectively to KG-D6. Of this 5.968 and 3.015 bcm of gas was produced from Godavari PML and D1 discovery of KG-DWN-98/2 block respectively, through KG-D6. The report further said by January 1, 2017, 7.519 and 4.377 bcm of gas would have migrated from Godavari PML and D1 discovery of KG-DWN-98/2 block respectively to RIL's KG-D6. Of this, 6.549 and 3.395 BCM of gas would have been produced from Godavari PML and D1 discovery of KG-DWN-98/2 block respectively through KG-D6.","Business, natural gas, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, PTI","PTI,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,natural gas",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-board-vertically-splitclaiming-gas-compensation_7526861.html

2016-09-25T11:36:08+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,ONGC Board approves pact to take stake in GSPC gas block,The Board of state-owned ONGC has approved signing of a preliminary agreement for buying a stake in Gujarat government firm GSPC's KG basin gas block.,"The Board of state-owned ONGC has approved signing of a preliminary agreement for buying a stake in Gujarat government firm GSPC's KG basin gas block. The Board of Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) at its meeting on September 8 approved signing of an MoU for taking a stake in Gujarat Petroleum Corp Ltd's (GSPC) difficult gas block, sources privy to the development said. The MoU approved strangely also incorporates a dispute resolution wherein any differences over issues like valuation or natural gas reserves would be referred to a three-member committee of outside experts. Sources said this is perhaps for the first time that a memorandum of understanding (MoU) sets out a dispute resolution committee and it perhaps is indication of the pitfalls that ONGC anticipates in buying a stake in the block. It has already differed with GSPC on the gas reserves the block holds and has appointed US-based consultant Ryder Scott to do an independent assessment. The three-member committee will have economist and former oil secretary Vijay Kelkar and former CVC P Shankar, they said adding the third member will be appointed in due course. Once all the three members are in place, the MoU will be inked, the sources added. Since the BJP-led government came to power at the Centre, the Gujarat government firm GSPC has been seeking to sell a majority stake in its KG-OSN-2001/3 (Deendayal) block in Bay of Bengal to ONGC to avoid defaulting on loans. ONGC initially was not keen to buy stake in the block as it felt the block had reserves far less than what GSPC was claiming and the asking price for the stake was not commensurate with the returns. But it has now agreed to look at the possibility and the MoU is a step further in that direction, they said. Ryder Scott Petroleum Consultants has been asked to evaluate gas properties in the GSPC block and independently certify the reserves quantities, the source said. GSPC was to begin gas production from the block in 2013 but after sinking in USD 3.6 billion it was found that gas reserves are one-tenth of 20 trillion cubic feet claimed in 2005 and that too is technically difficult to produce. In the process it has amassed Rs 19,576 crore of debt, on which interest cost was Rs 1,804.06 crore in 2014-15, according to the CAG. And against this its revenue was Rs 152.51 crore in 2014-15. Sources said GSPC has been doing trial production of a very small volume of gas from August 4, 2014 and has not yet reached commercial production and in absence of revenue commensurate with the debt servicing obligations it risks becoming a defaulter. To bail out of the situation, it offered to sell 50 percent stake to ONGC, they said.","Business, GSPC, KG basin, memorandum of understanding, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, PTI, Ryder Scott","PTI,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,GSPC,KG basin,memorandum of understanding,Ryder Scott",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-board-approves-pact-to-take-stakegspc-gas-block_7513001.html

These stakes are held through subsidiaries, branches and joint ventures. For operations of these projects, those units and joint ventures would raise a demand for money on the parent, OVL, which would transmit the investments.","The Tax Department has slapped a service tax demand of over Rs 6,100 crore on the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), a move that may potentially render its investments in oil and gas fields abroad infructuous. ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) has stakes in 37 oil and gas projects in 17 countries around the world. These stakes are held through subsidiaries, branches and joint ventures. For operations of these projects, those units and joint ventures would raise a demand for money on the parent, OVL, which would transmit the investments. The Service Tax Department now contends that the overseas units are rendering a service to OVL and as such the company is liable to pay service tax at the full rate, sources said. The department first issued a demand cum show-cause notice on October 11, 2011 requiring OVL to show cause why service tax amounting to Rs 2,816.31 crore plus interest on such amount and penalty should not be demanded and recovered. The tax amount was calculated based on foreign currency expenditure reported in the company's financial statements covering period from April 1, 2006 to March 31, 2010. Subsequently, five more demand-cum-show cause notices were issued covering period up to March 31, 2015 to show cause why service tax amounting to Rs 3,286.36 crore, the interest on such amount and penalty should not be demanded and recovered from the company. The Service Tax Department, sources said, has contended that the expenses represent business auxiliary services rendered by the company's foreign branches and operator of joint venture/consortium to the company. OVL however has contended that service tax is not payable and is contesting the same legally. According to OVL, investments made overseas through subsidiaries or branches or joint ventures do not constitute availing of any service. The company operates the projects at an internal rate of return on investments of 12-13 per cent and if it has to pay 14-15 per cent service tax on such investments, the projects will give negative returns and would become infructuous. Also, it contends that service tax by law can be levied on services rendered within the country. And even if one were to assume that its branches or subsidiaries were rendering any service, they were all overseas and not within India and so cannot be subject to any service tax, sources said. OVL had reported a net loss of Rs 2,093.5 crore in 2015- 16 fiscal on a turnover of Rs 12,772 crore. It had a net profit of Rs 1,904.2 crore on a turnover of Rs 19,148.9 crore in the previous fiscal. It produced 8.916 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas in 2015-16 as compared to 8.874 million tonnes in the previous year. The overall gas production slightly increased from 3.341 billion cubic meters during 2014-15 to 3.406 bcm in 2015-16 and oil production was almost flat at 5.51 million tonnes.","Business, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, ONGC Videsh Ltd, Tax, tax department","Tax Department,tax,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,ONGC Videsh Ltd,ONGC Videsh Ltd",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-videsh-slappedservice-tax-demandrs-6100-cr_7482561.html

OVL owns 40 percent of the San Cristobal field and had invested about USD 190 million in the project in 2008. State-run Petroleos de Venezuela S.A., or PDVSA, holds the remaining stake. &amp;quot;We have not been paid for our share of oil from the field for last few years,&amp;quot; a company official said. San Cristobal project covers an area of 160.18 square kilometers in the Zuata Subdivision of proliferous Orinoco Heavy Oil belt in Venezuela. The field currently produces about 28,000 barrels a day, down from a peak of 38,000 bpd. The official said OVL had received its dividend from sale of crude oil produced from the field totaling USD 56.224 million for 2008. But dividends for 2009 to 2013 totalling USD 537.631 million remained unpaid due to cash flow difficulties being faced by PDVSA. During 2015-16, OVL's share of crude oil production was 0.585 million tonnes as compared to 0.645 million tonnes during the previous fiscal. It's share of investment in the project was Rs 2,599.71 crore (USD 486.69 million) till March 31, 2016. Since PdVSA is facing a cash crunch, OVL wants its share of revenue from the field be paid in form of crude oil. &amp;quot;We want to be given physical oil which we can sell in international market to recover our dues,&amp;quot; he said. Venezuela, the cash-strapped OPEC member and holder of the world's biggest oil reserves, has been unable to pay foreign partners on some of its projects as revenues slumped along with crude prices and as funds were diverted to social programs and fuel subsidies. The Latin American nation earns almost all of its export revenue from oil. It is already repaying loans outstanding to China with crude and OVL is keen a similar deal. Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had discussed the past dues with visiting Venezuelan Foreign Minister Delcy Rodriguez and Oil Minister Eulogio del Pino last month. Another option was to deduct the outstanding from the money Indian firms like Reliance Industries and Essar Oil pay to import crude oil from Venezuela. But since all of the revenue from oil sales is budgeted by Venezuelan government, that option is ruled out, the official said. Venezuela is India's fourth largest source of crude oil, supplying some 23.6 million tonnes or 12 percent of the country's annual import in 2015-16.

The topline declined 22.1% YoY to Rs 17784.8 crore and came in above our estimate of Rs 18296.3 crore. The reported PAT declined 25% YoY to Rs 4232.5 crore and came in above our estimate of Rs 3306.9 crore, mainly due to lower than estimated operating expenses. The net realisation came in marginally higher at &amp;amp;#36;46.1/bbl than estimated &amp;amp;#36;45.8/bbl. There was nil subsidy during the quarter. OVL reported a net loss of Rs 2094 crore in FY16 against PAT of Rs 1904 crore in FY16. OVL&amp;amp;rsquo;s profitability continues to be a cause of concern for ONGC at lower crude oil prices. On the gas pricing front, as per the formula set by the government the APM gas prices are scheduled to be revised on October 1, 2016 and further lowering of the prices (20% estimate) from current &amp;amp;#36;3.4/mmbtu levels (GCV) will pressurise the company&amp;amp;rsquo;s operating performance. We assume government proposed subsidy sharing mechanism in our estimates, where it decided to cap its sharing of kerosene subsidy at Rs 12/litre and LPG at Rs 15/kg, with the rest being borne by oil PSUs. We have assumed the above subsidy sharing mechanism for the long term to arrive at a target price of Rs 240/share with EPS of Rs 18.7 and Rs 19.1 for FY17E and FY18E, respectively assuming Brent crude price at US&amp;amp;#36;45/bbl. However, if Brent crude price increases to US&amp;amp;#36; 50/bbl for the remaining period of FY17E and FY18E, ONGC&amp;amp;rsquo;s target price would change to Rs 264/share.

2016-09-08T22:40:03+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,Gas price for ONGC may be slashed by 20%: CMD Sarraf,"Natural gas price paid to producers, including state-owned ONGC, will be cut by 20 per cent to USD 2.5 per million British thermal unit in October, in line with a softening global trend, CMD D K Sarraf said today.","Natural gas price paid to producers, including state-ownedONGC, will be cut by 20 per cent to USD 2.5 per million British thermal unit in October, in line with a softening global trend, CMD D K Sarraf said today. This will be the fourth reduction in the last 18 months following the formula approved by the government in October 2014. Price of natural gas produced from the existing fields of ONGC and RIL is likely to fall to USD 2.5 per mmBtu with effect from October 1 as opposed to USD 3.06 currently, he said. &amp;quot;The price of normal domestic gas has been coming down because it is linked to gas price in certain markets. We have Canadian and the US price. They have been coming down,&amp;quot; he told reporters here. &amp;quot;We had started from USD 5.05, which used to be earlier USD 4.2 mmBtu. The current price is USD 3.06. As per the workings (calculations) which we have made, which will be effective October 1, it is going to be somewhere around or even less than USD 2.5 per mmBtu.&amp;quot; As per the new gas pricing formula approved by the NDA- government in October 2014, gas prices are to be revised every six months and the next change is due on October 1. The gas price was last slashed on April 1 to USD 3.06, from USD 3.82. On October 1 last year, the price of natural gas was lowered to USD 3.82, from USD 4.66. A price reduction on October 1 this year will put further pressure on finances of upstream producers that do not find the current rate higher enough to invest more in oil and gas hunt. &amp;quot;In terms of revenue, there will be a reduction of Rs 4,200 crore per dollar in a year. It translates into Rs 2,400 crore on the bottom line and Rs 4,200 crore on top line, Sarraf said. He went on to add that the government will support explorers if price is unremunerative. &amp;quot;I have full confidence that if our exploration or exploitation is not viable at USD 2.5 per mmBtu, then the government would definitely consider increase in price like they did for difficult fields,&amp;quot; he said. The government had earlier this year approved marketing and pricing freedom for all undeveloped discoveries in difficult areas subject to a cap. The limit for April 1 to September 30 was USD 6.61 per mmBtu.","Business, formula, gas price, India, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Reliance Industries, RIL","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,RIL,Reliance Industries,gas price,formula,India",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/gas-price-for-ongc-may-be-slashed-by-20-cmd-sarraf_7430841.html

But I think today I can speak to on GSPC. We have been talking to GSPC for acquiring certain percentage of their (Deendayal) field and the talks are on,&amp;quot; ONGC Chairman and Managing Director D K Sarraf told reporters here. Since the BJP-led government came to power at the Centre, the Gujarat government firm GSPC has been seeking to sell a majority stake in its KG-OSN-2001/3 (Deendayal) block in Bay of Bengal to ONGC to avoid defaulting on loans. ONGC initially was not keen to buy stake in the block as it felt the block had reserves far less than what GSPC was claiming and the asking price for the stake was not commensurate with the returns. &amp;quot;We did some technical study on the field and post that we thought that it would be better (to appoint a consultant) because it is quite a difficult field,&amp;quot; he said. Refusing to detail the size of the deal being discussed, he said the size of investment would be &amp;quot;significant&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;We have appointed a technical consultant Ryder and Scott for evaluation of the field,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;We are talking to GSPC for acquisition of certain percentage of their field.&amp;quot; Asked if an overseas partner may be roped in, he said, &amp;quot;as of now no.&amp;quot; Ryder Scott Petroleum Consultants has been asked to evaluate gas properties in the GSPC block and independently certify the reserves quantities, the source said. GSPC was to begin gas production from the block in 2013 but after sinking in USD 3.6 billion it was found that gas reserves are one-tenth of 20 trillion cubic feet claimed in 2005 and that too is technically difficult to produce. In the process it has amassed Rs 19,576 crore of debt, on which interest cost was Rs 1,804.06 crore in 2014-15, according to the CAG. And against this its revenue was Rs 152.51 crore in 2014-15. Sources said GSPC has been doing trial production of a very small volume of gas from August 4, 2014 and has not yet reached commercial production and in absence of revenue commensurate with the debt servicing obligations it risks becoming a defaulter. To bail out of the situation, it offered to sell 50 per cent stake to ONGC, they said. GSPC also wants ONGC to use its under-sea infrastructure for a fee. ONGC has gas discoveries in a neighbouring block and GSPC wants gas from those to be routed through its Deendayal block infrastructure for onward transportation to the shore. But the state-owned firm feels it was not technically feasible as its KG-D5 gas cannot be mixed with GSPC's gas which has high levels of sulphur and carbon dioxide content. Also it is high-pressure and high-temperature gas.","Business, K Sarraf, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, PTI, Ryder Scott","PTI,GSPC,ONGC,K Sarraf,Ryder Scott",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongctalks-to-buy-stakegspcs-kg-basin-block_7430441.html
2016-09-08T20:40:07+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,ONGC had no prior knowledge of gas seepage in KG basin: CMD,State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) today said unlike Reliance Industries it had no prior knowledge of natural gas from its block seeping into adjoining fields of the private firm.,"State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) today said unlike Reliance Industries it had no prior knowledge of natural gas from its block seeping into adjoining fields of the private firm. Justice A P Shah Committee last week opined that Reliance Industries should pay the government for the &amp;quot;unjust enrichment&amp;quot; by way of drawing natural gas from an adjacent block of ONGC in the KG basin of the Bay of Bengal since 2009. While holding that RIL may have had prior knowledge of the fields of the two companies being inter-connected and gas migrating from one to another, the report also recorded RIL charge that ONGC knew of the connectivity way back in 2007 but choose to remain silent till 2013. &amp;quot;ONGC had no knowledge about this earlier. As soon as we came to know about this we took action in 2013 (by approaching regulatory authorities). It seems that there is no mention our submission on this (Shah Committee) in the report. I don't know what is the reason for that and why there is no mention of our submissions,&amp;quot; ONGC Chairman and Managing Director D K Sarraf told reporters here. In submissions to the Shah Committee, &amp;quot;We had very strongly submitted that ONGC had no prior knowledge,&amp;quot; he said. In the report, the panel had sought enquiry into the allegations of prior knowledge on the part of both RIL and ONGC, with particular emphasis laid upon the failure of both parties to present the information they had to the DGH. Sarraf said the company spoke out in 2014 when the company apprehended that some portion of natural gas has flown from its fields to the adjacent KG-D6 block of RIL. &amp;quot;It was very tough statement to be made. It was made on the technical inputs.&amp;quot; First the technical consultant D&amp;amp;amp;M established that the reservoir between the blocks of ONGC and RIL are connected and then the Shah Committee also established that gas had indeed migrated or seeped. But the Shah Committee stated, &amp;quot;The Government of India, and not ONGC, is entitled to claim restitution from RIL for the unjust benefit it received and unfairly retained. ONGC has no locus standi to bring a tortuous claim against RIL for trespass/conversion since it does not have any ownership rights or possessory interest in the natural gas.&amp;quot; Sarraf said he was of the view that &amp;quot;it is difficult&amp;quot; to say at this moment whether ONGC has right over the compensation. Asked how confident you are of getting government's support on the issue when Prime Minister appeared in front page ad of Reliance Jio the very next day after Oil Minister said that government will take action on the Shah Report, he said, &amp;quot;These two things are totally unconnected. &amp;quot;The current government is acting without any bias. They have no bias against any PSU or a private sector. They would definitely decide on merit. That is my firm belief. That is why they appointed a committee. This means that government means business,&amp;quot; he said. He further said whether ONGC or the government would be paid will be &amp;quot;decided by the various stakeholders.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It is very difficult to say that whether ONGC or Government will get compensation,&amp;quot; he said.(Disclosure: RIL owns Network18 which publishes moneycontrol.com)","Business, natural gas, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, PTI","PTI,natural gas,ONGC",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-had-no-prior-knowledgegas-seepagekg-basin-cmd_7430221.html

The one-man Committee headed by Ajit Prakash Shah, former Chief Justice of Delhi High Court, submitted to Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan a report containing not just the compensation to be paid for ONGC's gas migrating to adjacent KG-D6 block of RIL in the Krishna Godavari basin, but also recommendations for avoiding such disputes in future. As much as 11.122 billion cubic meters of ONGC gas had migrated from its Godavari-PML and KG-DWN-98/2 blocks to adjoining KG-D6 of RIL between April 1, 2009 and March 31, 2015. At prevailing prices, the gas was worth Rs 11,000 crore. While ONGC's reservoirs have almost emptied, RIL continues to produce gas from D1&amp;amp;amp;D3 fields in KG-D6 block, some of it being of ONGC.

He has preliminary briefed us on report,&amp;quot; he said without giving details. The panel has given &amp;quot;some observations&amp;quot; on the report of the independent expert DeGolyer &amp;amp;amp; MacNaughton (D&amp;amp;amp;M) that established reservoir continuity between the KG-D6 and contiguous ONGC operated blocks.

This is the fourth extension for OVL to explore Block-128, the license for which is now valid till June 15, 2017, sources privy to the development said. OVL had in May applied to the Vietnamese authorities for a fourth extension of the exploration licence for the deepsea block to maintain India's strategic interest in the South China Sea. Vietnam's national oil company PetroVietnam has granted the extension, sources said. OVL had signed Production Sharing Contract (PSC) for the 7,058 square km Block 128 in offshore PhuKhanh Basin, Vietnam on May 24, 2006. Ministry of Planning &amp;amp;amp; Investment (MPI), Vietnam issued investment licence for the block on June 16, 2006, being effective date of the PSC. The company has not found any hydrocarbon in the block but is continuing to stay invested. OVL first took a two-year extension of the exploration period till June 2014 and then another one year. A third extension was granted on May 28, 2015 and now a fourth extension has been granted. The company has so far invested USD 50.88 million in the block. The block lies in the part of South China Sea over which China claims sovereignty. In 2011, Beijing had warned OVL that its exploration activities off the Vietnam coast were illegal and violated China's sovereignty, but the company continued exploring for oil and gas. OVL forayed into Vietnam as early as 1988, when it bagged the exploration licence for Block 6.1. The company got two exploration blocks - Block 127 and Block 128 - in 2006. However, Block 127 was relinquished due to poor prospectives, the other Block was retained. The first extension followed China putting the area under Block 128 for global bidding. China claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea where the two Blocks are located and had warned the Indian arm from drilling in the region. OVL continues to own 45 percent stake in Vietnam's offshore Block 6.1 and its share of production was 2.023 billion cubic metres of gas and 0.036 million tonnes of condensate. The company in October 2014 signed an agreement to pick up to 50 percent stake in the two exploration blocks in the South China Sea.

According to the statement, in its recent funding round, the Australia India Strategic Research Fund (AISRF) announced a new grant of Australian Dollar one million to support the project. It said that simply by adding a common synthetic dye, microbiologists at UNSW Australia have demonstrated a tenfold increase in the volume of methane generated by microbes in coal seams, and even larger gains in biogas derived from agricultural and food waste. UNSW's researchers have already replicated the extraordinary gains in gas volumes outside the laboratory, in tests in coal seams west of Sydney. However, Indian trials will enable a battery of industrial scale tests factoring in critical variables such as coal seam pressure and temperature, as well as enabling the development of new technologies to precisely introduce the dye. The breakthrough could extend the life of coal seam gas wells as well as greatly boost gas yields from bio-digesters that use carbon neutral organic waste to generate methane for electricity production. The India-based project is also expected to deliver new fundamental knowledge about how methane-producing microbes work.","agricultural, Business, coal, gas, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, University of New South Wales","University of New South Wales,gas,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,coal,gas,agricultural",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/unsw-australia-to-lend-expertiseongc-wells_7322761.html

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), IOC and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) have agreed to take one million tons per annum capacity each on the 5 million tons a year floating LNG terminal planned at Jafrabad port in Gujarat, sources privy to the negotiations said. Gujarat State Petroleum Corp Ltd (GSPC) too is in talks to take 1.5 million tons capacity in the floating, storage and regasification unit (FSRU). The companies hiring the capacity will bring their own LNG from abroad and pay Swan a tolling fee. Swan Energy is building the project in joint venture with Exmar of Belgium. The company had last year secured all necessary permits for the project and the state-owned firms agreed to hire 60 percent capacity of the terminal on tolling basis for importing their own gas will help Swan take the final investment decision and tie-up project financing. ONGC and IOC own 12.5 percent stake each in Petronet LNG Ltd, which owns and operates a 10 million tons a year liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal at Dahej in Gujarat. This terminal is being expanded to 15 million tons by next month. While Petronet expanded the Dahej terminal on premise of leasing out the capacity third parties, the company also has a 5 million tons a year LNG import facility at Kochi on the west coast.

ONGC is the operator of the Bokaro coal-bed methane (CBM) Block BK-CBM-2001/1 with 80 per cent stake while the remaining 20 per cent is with Indian Oil Corp (IOC). &amp;quot;Investment decisions have been taken by ONGC Board for development of Bokaro CBM Block (BK-CBM-2001/1) at a total project cost of Rs 823 crore,&amp;quot; Sarraf said in the company's latest Annual Report for 2015-16. CBM is a form of natural gas extracted from underground coal beds, and ONGC's share in this project would be Rs 658.62 crore. &amp;quot;The project envisages coal bed methane gas production of 4.068 billion cubic meters in 20 years with a peak of 0.9 million standard cubic meters per day and a plateau production of 0.75 mmscmd,&amp;quot; Sarraf said, adding that the &amp;quot;production from this project is expected to commence during 2017-18&amp;quot;. It includes drilling of 141 wells with multilayer hydro- fracturing and installation of three production facilities. ONGC had won the Bokaro block in the first round of CBM block bidding in 2003. The company has so far been awarded nine CBM blocks, of which it has relinqished five. It produces 0.007 mmscmd of gas from its Jharia CBM block in Jharkhand and output is projected to touch 0.05 mmscmd by 2017-18. ONGC holds 85 per cent interest in the Jharia block while Coal India Ltd has the remaining 26 per cent. Besides, ONGC also operates North Karanpura block and Raniganj North CBM block in West Bengal. The Jharia block is estimated to hold 85 billion cubic metres of gas reserves, North Karanpura 62 billion cubic metres, Bokaro 45 billion cubic metres and Raniganj North 43 billion cubic metres. Officials said the Raniganj North in West Bengal may have to be relinquished as it may fall in way of a planned air- strip. &amp;quot;No development phase activity could commence in the block due to non-grant of Petroleum Mining Lease (PML) from West Bengal government due to overlap with BAPL airport project,&amp;quot; an official said. The remaining three blocks can produce a peak of 3.2 mmscmd of gas. ONGC will drill over 350 wells in three blocks in Jharia, Bokaro and North Karanpur in Jharkhand, he said, adding that the peak output of 3.2 mmscmd is likely in 2020-21.&amp;amp;nbsp;","Business, coal, natural gas, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,coal,natural gas",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-partners-to-invest-rs-823-cr-for-gasbokaro-block_7273681.html

2016-08-09T09:24:03+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,ONGC over-reported crude oil production by 12%: CAG,"In a report tabled in Parliament, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) said ONGC 'over-reported' its crude oil production by 12 per cent through inclusion of items like condensate in the output.","State-owned ONGC shelled out Rs 18,787 crore in excess subsidy over 3 years as it 'over- reported' crude oil production by 12 per cent, which also resulted in extra payment of peformance related pay to its executives, government auditor CAG said today. In a report tabled in Parliament, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) said ONGC 'over-reported' its crude oil production by 12 per cent through inclusion of items like condensate in the output. &amp;quot;Audit of the crude oil measurement and reporting system indicated that the company (ONGC) was reporting partially stabilized crude oil as its crude oil production. &amp;quot;This led to over-reporting of crude production by including items other than crude oil, namely, off-gas, BS&amp;amp;amp;W (impurities) and recoverable internal consumption,&amp;quot; it said. Basic sediment and water (BS&amp;amp;amp;W) is a technical specification of certain impurities in crude oil. ONGC has also reported 'condensate' production inappropriately as crude oil production, though both products were identified distinct and treated differently by it. Out of 132.17 million tons of crude oil production claimed by ONGC in five years from 2010-11 to 2014-15, as much as 12.1 per cent of over 6 million tons was over-reported. &amp;quot;The over-reporting and incorrect reporting of crude oil production has presented an inaccurate picture of performance of the company on crude oil production and has led to the company sharing an additional subsidy burden of Rs 18,787.43 crore during 2012 and 2015,&amp;quot; CAG said. Besides, the over-reporting also resulted in over payment of performance related pay (PRP) to the company executives and staff. &amp;quot;With ageing of fields (majority bring more than 30 years old), there has been an increase in water cut. This coupled with lack of adequate handling/processing facilities at the production installations resulted in higher proportion of BS&amp;amp;amp;W and off gas in the crude oil. &amp;quot;The company, however, reported crude oil production without adjusting these elements fully,&amp;quot; CAG said, adding that anomalies were noticed in the measurement practices. The auditor recommended that the loss/gain during transportation of crude oil through closed pipeline systems should be closely monitored to ensure that the variations are in normal range and identify abnormal loss/gain for corrective action. Also, asset-specific standard operating procedure (SOPs) for measurement of crude oil production may be formulated and implemented. &amp;quot;The company may report condensate as a separate stream as opined by international consultant,&amp;quot; CAG added.","Basic sediment and water (BS&W), Business, Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, PTI, standard operating procedure (SOPs)","PTI,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) ,Basic sediment and water (BS&amp;amp;W),standard operating procedure (SOPs)",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-over-reported-crude-oil-production-by-12-cag_7229081.html

Strikes and blockages by some students' unions, among others, that crippled oil and gas output of Oil India Ltd (OIL) and ONGC were organised in Assam last month after the government put on auction 12 of their discovered fields as part of selling 67 such discovered fields of the two PSUs. &amp;quot;This Ministry has received various petitions both from civil and political affiliations from the state of Assam against the decision of the Union Government to auction 12 discovered oil/gas fields of ONGC/OIL,&amp;quot; Pradhan said in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha here. These fields, he said, were discovered by Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and OIL long back but could not be monetised due to various reasons. In the auction, the government is offering liberal fiscal terms as well as pricing and marketing freedom. The two state- run firms say they could not monetise the fields because a market price was not available to them. &amp;quot;By adopting Small Discovered Field Policy, Government has attempted to include certain reforms in the hydrocarbon exploration and production management with sole intention to monetize these fields at the earliest to increase the production,&amp;quot; he said. Pradhan said the new policy does not debar ONGC and OIL from participating in the bidding process. &amp;quot;To address the misunderstandings amongst the public about the decision of Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas on Discovered Small Field Bid Round 2016, a half-page advertisement was brought out in 12 regional newspapers of Assam on July 18, 2016 jointly by government oil PSUs viz OIL and ONGC,&amp;quot; he said. He sought to justify the auction saying that oil and gas fields are awarded by government through international competitive bidding since 1998-99 under New Exploration and Licensing Policy (NELP). &amp;quot;As such, the decision to award the (12) fields are in line with the existing policy of Government of India,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;This policy does not debar government companies to participate in the bidding process.

2016-08-08T09:30:08+05:30,ONGC,Faizan Javed,Govt may cut gas price for producers by 20% in October,"Price of natural gas produced from existing fields of ONGC and RIL is likely to fall to USD 2.45 per million British thermal unit with effect from October 1 as opposed to USD 3.06 currently, a senior official said.","Natural gas price paid to producers like state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Reliance Industries is likely to fall 20 percent to USD 2.45 in October. This will be the fourth reduction in last 18 months following the formula approved by the government in October 2014. Price of natural gas produced from existing fields of ONGC and RIL is likely to fall to USD 2.45 per million British thermal unit with effect from October 1 as opposed to USD 3.06 currently, a senior official said. This rate is on gross calorific value (GCV) basis. The gas price was last cut on April 1 from USD 3.82 per mmBtu to USD 3.06 per mmBtu. On a net-calorific value (NCV) basis, the gas price was on that day cut to USD 3.4 per mmBtu as compared to USD 4.24 previously. On NCV basis, the new gas price is likely to be USD 2.7 from October 1. As per the new gas pricing formula approved by the NDA- government in October 2014, gas prices are to be revised every six months and the next change is due on October 1. The reduction in natural gas prices would mean lower raw material cost for compressed natural gas (CNG) and natural gas piped to households (PNG) and would translate into reduction in retail prices. This will be the fourth consecutive reduction since the implementation of the domestic gas pricing formula that calculates the rate on a volume weighted average of rates in gas surplus nations of the US, Canada and Russia, based on the 12-month trailing average price with a lag of three months. The price of gas has declined by around 39 percent since the implementation of the gas pricing formula in October 2014. On October 1, 2015 price of natural gas was lowered to USD 3.82 per mmBtu from USD 4.66. The price cut on October 1, 2016 will put further pressure on finances of upstream producers who do not find the current rate incentivising enough to invest more in oil and gas hunt. The official said the cap price based on alternative fuels for undeveloped gas finds in difficult areas like deep sea will also fall to around USD 5.2-5.3 per mmBtu from USD 6.61 currently. The government had earlier this year approved marketing and pricing freedom for all undeveloped discoveries lying in difficult areas subject to a cap. The cap for April 1 to September 30 was USD 6.61 per mmBtu on GCV basis and USD 7.3 on NCV basis, the official said.","Business, natural gas, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Reliance Industries","Natural gas,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Reliance Industries",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/govt-may-cut-gas-price-for-producers-by-20october_7219641.html

While OIL Chairman and Managing Director Utpal Bora handed over a cheque of Rs 1,149.24 crore to Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) CMD Dinesh K Sarraf presented a cheque of Rs 300.64 crore. Speaking on the occasion, Pradhan alleged that Congress President Sonia Gandhi in a bid to &amp;quot;punish people of Gujarat for re-electing Narendra Modi as Chief Minister in 2007&amp;quot; had changed the way royalty is paid to crude oil producing states. In trying to target Gujarat, Assam too became a victim, he said. Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma too said the methodology of charging royalty was changed to &amp;quot;curtail economic prosperity of Gujarat&amp;quot; but in the process &amp;quot;Assam too was weakened.&amp;quot; According to the Oil Field Act, ONGC/OIL are required to pay 20 per cent royalty on price of crude oil it extracts from onland oil blocks to the state governments. But the government in 2004 order asking them to share a part of the subsidy on petrol, diesel and cooking fuels LPG and kerosene by way of giving discount of crude oil they sell to refiners. In 2008, the government asked them to pay royalty on the discounted price, thereby impact revenue of oil producing states like Gujarat and Assam. Gujarat government in 2011 filed a petition before the High Court, stating that it should be paid royalty at market rate and the difference in royalty payment since 2008 at pre- discount rate (in comparison to market rate) was computed at Rs 9,000 crore to Rs 10,000 crore. The High Court ruled in its favour in November 2013. ONGC challenged the decision in the Supreme Court which asked the company pay Gujarat at gross or pre-discount price during pendency of the petition. While Gujarat was getting royalty at pre-discounted rates, Assam was paid the duty at discounted rate. The government last month ordered ONGC and OIL to pay Assam royalty at pre-discounted rates from back date of February 2014. The royalty for the period since February 2014 was paid to Assam government today. Pradhan said he had in April 2015 asked the then Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi to also take the Gujarat route and field petition in court but &amp;quot;they filed a petition but did not fight it.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Gross injustice was done to Assam and today we are here to rectify that,&amp;quot; he said. Sarma blamed former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for doing injustice to Assam by imposing an unfair royalty calculation formula despite representing the state in the Upper House.

It is an idea which was reportedly mooted by a Director of a state-owned company and like all ideas have to be debated, we are debating it,&amp;quot; he said here. His ministry has 13 PSUs ranging from upstream oil producers like ONGC and Oil India to downstream oil refining and fuel marketing firms IOC, BPCL and HPCL to gas transporter GAIL India Ltd to engineering firm Engineers India Ltd. An idea was mooted to merge them to create a behemoth that cannot just compete globally but also withstand the oil price volatility by using profits refining business make in low oil prices to make up for losses in upstream and vice versa. Pradhan said it was just an idea and he is willing to look at an viable proposition. &amp;quot;I am open at looking at options... that's all I have said,&amp;quot; he said. The top eight listed state-owned oil and gas companies have a combined market capitilization of about USD 80 billion, which will make a combined entity the ninth largest oil firm globally. Pradhan also said he is pitching the finance ministry to cut cess on domestically produced crude oil to provide life to companies like Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC). &amp;quot;It should be according to market dynamics,&amp;quot; he said adding he has asked the Ministry of Finance to look into request by oil producers like ONGC and Cairn India to reduce cess. In the Budget for 2016-17, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had moved from a fixed Rs 4,500 per ton cess on domestically produced crude oil to a percentage of oil prices or ad valorem rate of 20 per cent. At crude oil price of USD 45 per barrel, the two break even and if rates go up, oil companies will end up paying more, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Dinesh K Sarraf said. &amp;quot;I am recommending to Ministry of Finance to look into expectation of E&amp;amp;amp;P sector,&amp;quot; he said.","Bharat Petroleum Corporation, Business, Dharmendra Pradhan, Engineers India, GAIL India, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, India, Indian Oil Corporation, merger, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Oil India","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Indian Oil Corporation,GAIL India,Oil India,Bharat Petroleum Corporation,Hindustan Petroleum Corporation,Engineers India,merger,India,Dharmendra Pradhan",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ministry-not-considering-merger13-oil-psus-pradhan_7180481.html

The overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) said the acquisition of 15 percent stake in JSC Vankorneft -- a company organised under the law of Russian Federation, which is the owner of Vankor Field and North Vankor licence -- was completed on May 31. Rosneft, the national oil company of Russia continues to hold the remaining 85 percent shares of JSC Vankorneft, the developer of the Vankor oil and gas condensate field in Turukhansky district of Krasnoyak Territory in Russia. The field, which has recoverable reserves of 2.5 billion barrels, will give OVL 3.3 million tonnes per annum of oil production. OVL said in a statement that the deal to acquire stake in Vankor was signed by its Managing Director &amp;amp;amp; CEO Narendra K Verma and Rosneft head Igor Sechin in early September last year. Further to that, Rosneft agreed to sell another 11 percent stake in Vankor to OVL. Details of this deal are yet to be finalised. &amp;quot;Vankor is Rosneft's (and Russia's) second largest field by production and accounts for 4 percent of Russian crude oil production. The daily peak production from the field is around 442,000 barrels of oil per day. With 15 percent shareholding, OVL's share of daily oil production would be about 66,000 bpd,&amp;quot; the statement said. The acquisition strengthens OVL's presence in Russia and is consistent with &amp;quot;stated strategic objective of adding high quality international assets to its existing E&amp;amp;amp;P portfolio,&amp;quot; the statement said. It also has &amp;quot;significant strategic importance to India, both in terms of augmentation of India's energy security as well as adding a new dimension to the relationship between Rosneft and OVL besides further strengthening the cooperation between the two countries,&amp;quot; it added. This will be the fourth biggest acquisition by OVL. It had in 2013 paid USD 4.125 billion for a 16 percent stake in Mozambique's offshore Rovuma Area 1, which holds as much as 75 Trillion cubic feet of gas reserves. In 2009, it had bought Russia-focused Imperial Energy for USD 2.1 billion. Prior to that, it had in 2001 paid USD 1.7 billion for a 20 percent interest in the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas field off Russia's far eastern coast.

ONGC produced 22.37 million tonne of crude oil in the financial year ended March 31, 2016, a notch higher than 22.26 MT in the previous fiscal, a senior company official said. In 2014-15 it had reversed a 7-year declining trend in crude oil production as it brought small and marginal fields in western offshore to production. Output of 22.263 MT of crude oil from April 2014 to March 31, 2015 was higher than 22.247 MT in the previous fiscal. &amp;quot;Most of our major fields are three to four decade old where natural decline has set it. So the challenge before us is to arrest this by investing in enhanced and increased oil recovery schemes and bring newer deposits into production,&amp;quot; he said. ONGC used to produce more than three-fourth of country's oil needs but that share has slipped down to 60 percent now. It had produced 26.05 million tons of crude oil in 2006-07, which dipped to 25.94 MT in the following year. That year its share in nation's oil production of 33.51 MT was 75.7 percent. ONGC's production fell to 25.37 MT in 2008-09; 24.67 MT in 2009-10; 24.42 MT in 2010-11; 23.71 MT in 2010-11; 22.56 MT in 2012-13 and to 22.25 MT in 2013-14. Its 22.37 MT of output in 2015-16 is 60.5 percent of country's 36.95 MT of production. The company has been under critical scrutiny ever since the BJP government took office in May 2014. Oil Ministry has been monitoring its performance on a monthly basis. The official said output has increased primarily due to about 1 MT of additional production from offshore fields. Natural gas production however continues decline, falling to 21.17 billion cubic meters (BCM) in 2015-16 from 22.02 bcm in the previous fiscal. ONGC, which produced 22.49 bcm of gas in 2008-09, saw output peak to 23.55 bcm in 2012-13 but has since then been falling. Its current output makes up for 65.6 percent of the country's production of 32.25 bcm. &amp;quot;We are in the process of developing a series of gas fields on both western and eastern offshore and production will start to look up from this fiscal,&amp;quot; the official said.","Business, natural gas, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Oil production","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,oil production,Natural gas",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-crude-oil-output-upfy16_6595981.html

India, which got USD 15 billion of benefits during first 11 years of the term-contract with Qatar beginning 2003 by way of enjoying low gas prices when world energy rates were rising, is currently paying less than USD 5 per million British thermal unit for 7.5 million tonnes a year of LNG it buys from RasGas of Qatar. &amp;quot;Earlier the prices during 2015 were in excess of USD 12 per mmBtu. The current price applicable under the contract works out to less than USD 5 per mmBtu based on prevailing crude prices,&amp;quot; he said in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha. This revision, applicable from January 1, has led to making LNG cheaper for the end consumers, he said. The revised formula will base the price on a three-month average figure of Brent crude oil, replacing a five-year average of a basket of crude imported by Japan, with a rider that PLL buys an additional 1 million tonnes of LNG annually. Further, Petronet LNG Ltd - the firm that imported LNG from RasGas of Qatar - has executed agreement for additional supply of 1 million tonnes per annum of LNG for about 12 years with effect from January 1, 2016 at the prevailing market prices, he said. Pradhan said Qatar will also not seek Rs 12,000 crore from PLL for 'under-lifting' LNG from RasGas by 38 percent. &amp;quot;RasGas and Petronet LNG Ltd agreed to rescheduled the LNG quantity not taken by Petronet LNG Ltd during 2015 to a future period and RasGas has agreed to waive the take or pay liability under the contract for the year 2015,&amp;quot; he said. Petronet, a joint venture of state-owned Indian Oil Corp, GAIL India Ltd, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL), had started importing LNG - natural gas supercooled to liquid state for ease of transportation in ships - from 2004.","Bharat Petroleum Corporation, Business, Dharmendra Pradhan, GAIL India, Indian Oil Corporation, LNG, Lok Sabha, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Petronet LNG, Qatar","LNG,Qatar,Lok Sabha,Dharmendra Pradhan,Petronet LNG,Indian Oil Corporation,GAIL India,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Bharat Petroleum Corporation",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/revised-qatar-lng-deal-slashes-gas-price-to-below-365-per-mmbtu_6499661.html

According to the minutes of a recent meeting of the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) of Ministry of Environment and Forests, the PSU sought the ministry's nod to prepare Terms of Reference for exploring the wells. A senior official of the PSU said this is the first time that the oil and gas company has taken up shale gas exploration in such a big scale. Also, it first time that it has taken up shale gas exploration in the Krishna-Godavari basin. According to the minutes, ONGC sought permission for drilling 11 exploratory wells for shale oil/shale gas in Cambay basin at Mehsana, Ahmedabad and Bharuch districts of Gujarat, one well in Cauvery basin at Nagapattinam in Tamil Nadu and five wells in KG Basin at East and West Godavari districts of Andhra Pradesh. Shale gas is the natural gas that is trapped within shale formations. Shales are fine-grained sedimentary rocks that can be rich resources of petroleum and natural gas. &amp;quot;ONGC Ltd has proposed for exploratory drilling of 11 wells for shale oil/shale gas in Cambay basin at Mehsana, Ahmedabad, Bharuch in Gujarat. Total cost of project is Rs 366 crores,&amp;quot; according to the minutes of the meeting. The costs of the projects at KG-Basin and Cauvery are Rs 217 crore and Rs 45 crore, respectively, it added. &amp;quot;ONGC was given a mandate to identify a minimum of 50 nomination blocks where it will take up shale gas and oil exploration in Phase-I. &amp;quot;ONGC will have to drill at least one (two in blocks having area more than 200 sq km) well for assessment of shale gas and oil in each of these blocks by 2017,&amp;quot; the official cited above told PTI. Realising the importance of shale gas and oil for meeting the energy demands of the country and the need to expedite exploration and assessment of domestic reserves, the Centre had announced policy guidelines on October 14, 2013, whereby national oil companies ONGC and OIL were to take up shale gas and oil exploration activities in their nomination blocks. According to a report released in 2013 by US Energy Information Agency, India has 63 trillion cubic feet of shale gas trapped under rocks.","Business, expert appraisal committee, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, PTI",PTI,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-to-drill-17-exploratory-wells-for-shale-gas_6384501.html

One of the striking features of the ONGC's 2016-17 insurance renewal has been competitive bidding where the country's only national reinsurer GIC Re has managed to outbid its international peers. In 2015-16, two European reinsurers -- Endurance and Aspen -- had outbid GIC Re to be the lead reinsurer for the deal. &amp;quot;ONGC has renewed its insurance account for its offshore assets worth USD 34 billion for a premium of around USD 16 million, more than 25 per cent lower than what it had paid for last year,&amp;quot; industry sources told PTI today. The insurance cover, due for renewal on May 11, has been renewed in the London markets, they said. Global general insurance prices have been heading south as claims have been lower unlike the previous year wherein claims were higher due to many catastrophes and aviation accidents. This is the second year that the state-run oil and gas major, which has the largest insurable assets in the country, has managed to get a discount. Last fiscal, it had renewed its policies at almost 35 per cent discount at USD 20 million. Given the limited capacity for risks in the country, over 80 per cent of ONGC's insurance cover is usually reinsured by global reinsurers.","Business, GIC Re, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, premium, United India Insurance","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,United India Insurance,GIC Re,premium",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-gets-25-discountpremiumunited-india-gic-re_6274301.html

The move will help save the company Rs 3,000-4,000 crore needed to build offshore infrastructure to produce gas from the Daman gas field as well as C-26 Cluster projects, ONGC Director (Offshore) Tapas Kumar Sengupta told PTI here. &amp;quot;We plan to start producing gas from Daman using the abandoned Tapti facilities by August/September at the rate of 2 million standard cubic meters per day,&amp;quot; he said. Peak output of 8.35 mmscmd of gas and 9,286 barrels of condensate per day is likely by 2018-19, he said. C-26 Cluster will contribute another 3 mmcmd and about 2,000 barrels of condensate per day. With Mid &amp;amp;amp; South Tapti field output declining rapidly, partners in the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields - RIL, BG and ONGC, decided to abandon the field last year. &amp;quot;Tapti at its peak produced 12 mmscmd of gas but the output dwindled to 0.1 mmscmd and partners decided to abandon it and return the field to the government. Government on its part handed over certain facilities of the field to ONGC to achieve early production from Daman,&amp;quot; he said. Abandonment means dismantling and removing infrastructure set up for production of oil and gas. Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) plans to use the Tapti field assets, which include sub-sea pipelines and gas gathering stations as well as process platform, to advance production of gas from its neighbouring Daman field. The assets include Tapti gas processing platform, which received gas from sub-sea wells, removes water and other impurities before transmitting it to onshore. ONGC will lay a small length of pipeline from the Daman field to the process platform, which is connected by a 70-km pipeline to its facility at Hazira. The official said the company is investing Rs 5,219 crore in bringing to production the Daman gas fields and another Rs 3,400 crore in C-26 Cluster. ONGC holds 40 per cent interest in the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields while RIL and BP have 30 per cent each. The joint venture will continue to operate the Panna- Mukta field, which primarily is an oil bearing field located 90-km north-west of Mumbai in the Arabian Sea. It currently produces 19,000 barrels per day of oil and 5-6 mmscmd of gas. The JV members signed the Tapti Asset Transfer Agreement yesterday with ONGC, Sengupta said. This is first of its kind asset transfer agreement in India, demonstrating that facilities no longer required by an operator can be optimally used by another to expedite the field development activities and also to reduce capex burden. &amp;amp;nbsp;","assets, BG, Business, infrastructure, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Reliance Industries","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,assets,Reliance Industries,BG,infrastructure",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-takes-over-tapti-assetsbg-reliance_6252621.html

Looking to cut import dependence by boosting domestic production, the government pushed cash-rich PSUs to take up Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand. Prime Minister's Office (PMO) called a high-level meeting of Fertiliser Minister Ananth Kumar, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and Power &amp;amp;amp; Coal Minister Piyush Goyal to chalk out the revival plan which would hinge on availability of natural gas. State gas utility GAIL India Ltd has been asked to expedite the pipeline from Jagdishpur in Uttar Pradesh to Haldia in West Bengal to provide connectivity to the shut urea plants at Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, Barauni in Bihar and Sindhri in Jharkhand. According to sources, ONGC will form joint venture with Hindustan Fertiliser Corporation Ltd (HFCL) for revival of urea plant at Barouni. Fertiliser Corporation of India Ltd (FCIL) will form two separate joint ventures with CIL and NTPC for revival of Sindri and Gorakhpur respectively. The secretaries of fertiliser, power, coal, petroleum and finance alongwith officials of various PSUs were also present at the meeting. Last year, the Cabinet had approved the revival of Barouni, Gorakhpur and Sindri through bidding process. But the response to the bidding was poor, as Adani was the only bidder for Sindri and Matix for Gorakhpur. Besides these three, the revival of other two closed urea plants at Talcher in Odisha and Ramagundam in Telangana has already started. India's urea production touched record 24.5 million tonnes in 2015-16 fiscal. While the country's total demand is about 30 million tonnes, the rest is met through imports. Urea is a controlled fertiliser and its selling price is fixed at Rs 5,360 per tonne.

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) will pay USD 995.26 million for the three discoveries in the KG-OSN-2001/3 block that are under trial production since August 2014. Another USD 200 million will be paid as advance consideration of six other discoveries, for which GSPC has been finalising an investment plan from bringing them to production. &amp;quot;Once the field development plan (FDP), which details the producible gas reserves, is approved by the regulator DGH, we will arrive at a valuation and pay GSPC,&amp;quot; a top ONGC official said. Besides the payout to GSPC, ONGC will have to pay for the entire development cost of the six discoveries which may run into at least a couple of billion dollars. GSPC, which had a debt of Rs 19,716.27 crore as on March 31, 2015, has so far made 9 gas discoveries in the Bay of Bengal block. Of these, three - KG-08, KG-17, KG-15 - commonly known as Deendayal West (DDW) fields - have been approved for development. But against an approved field development plan (FDP) cost of USD 2.75 billion, GSPC seen a huge cost-overrun, incurring USD 2.83 billion as on March 31, 2015. Additionally, it had incurred an exploration cost of USD 584.63 million, taking total expenditure as on March 31, 2015 to USD 3.41 billion. As per the requirement of the FDP, 12 more development wells are yet to be completed which would further escalate the project cost. The trial production from the DDW field commenced in August 2014, but the average production achieved is only 19.45 million standard cubic feet per day against a targeted commercial production of 200 mmscfd. Commercial production has not commenced as production rate has not yet stabilised, the official said. The DGH approved FDP had envisaged commercial production from December 2011.

Net profit for April-September was at Rs 512 crore, 126.55 percent higher than Rs 226 crore for the same period in the year-ago period, the company said in a statement. OVL, which has projects in 15 countries from Venezuela to New Zealand, reported a 3 percent rise in standalone crude oil production at 1.3 million tonnes. Consolidated crude oil production was up 29 percent at 3.6 million tonnes while gas output was 13 percent higher at 1.87 billion cubic meters. The consolidated oil production was higher due to the acquisition of 15 percent stake in Russia's Vankor oilfield. The net profit was higher despite a 8.5 percent drop in revenue to Rs 3,457 crore. The profit was higher &amp;quot;due to reduced depreciation, depletion and amortisation expenses and forex gains,&amp;quot; the statement said without giving details. OVL is unlisted 100 percent subsidiary of ONGC and by regulation is not required to give out quarterly earning numbers. The company completed acquisition of 15 percent stake in Vankor field in East Siberia in May and subsequently acquired another 11 percent stake from Rosneft Oil Company on October this year. Vankor is Russia's second largest field by production and accounts for 4 percent of Russian output. &amp;quot;The average daily production from the field is around 415,500 barrels per day of crude oil since acquisition and OVL's share of daily oil production from Vankor (considering both the acquisitions) will be about 108,030 barrels a day,&amp;quot; the statement said. OVL said it has signed an agreement with Petroleos De Venezuela SA (PDVSA) for facilitating redevelopment of the San Cristobal joint venture project in Venezuela. &amp;quot;The redevelopment plan aims to increase the current level of production of about 18,000 barrels per day to 27,000 barrels a day by use of water flooding techniques,&amp;quot; the statement said. The agreement also provides for mechanism to liquidate OVL's outstanding dividends from the project and to obtain term finance for the USD 318 million capital investment for implementing the redevelopment plan, it added. OVL owns 40 percent of Venezuela's San Cristobal oilfield and had invested about USD 190 million in the project in 2008. PDVSA holds the remaining stake. It has not been paid for its share of oil from the San Cristobal field in last few years. After this agreement, PDVSA has agreed to supply 17,000 barrels per day of crude oil to repay USD 537 million that it owes to OVL.","Business, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, ONGC Videsh","ONGC Videsh,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-videsh-h1-net-profit-more-than-doubles-to-rs-512-crore_8121221.html

About a year ago, ONGC submitted to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) a field development plan (FDP) for bringing to production 10 oil and gas discoveries in KG basin block KG-DWN-98/2 (KG-D5), which sits next to Reliance Industries flagging KG-D6 fields. DGH so far has not approved the FDP, an official said. A meeting of the block oversight panel, Management Committee (MC) headed by DGH, has been called next week to review the FDP, he said. &amp;quot;Without waiting for the approval, tendering for long-lead items has started to ensure the 2019- 20 schedule for starting production is not missed,&amp;quot; he said. The board of ONGC had on March 28 approved an investment of USD 5,076.37 million for developing Cluster-II discoveries to flow natural gas from from June 2019 and oil by March 2020. &amp;quot;While the FDP was submitted a year, the board gave investment approval in March after the government allowed higher rates for deepwater discoveries, thus making KG-D5 viable,&amp;quot; he said, adding since then DGH nod is awaited. In 2014, ONGC had announced plans to start gas production from 2018 and oil by 2019 but a final investment decision was made contingent upon government approving a remunerative price for the deepsea block as the current rate of USD 2.5 per million British thermal unit was unviable. The government in March announced a new pricing formula for difficult areas that would at current prices give developers just about USD 6 per mmBtu price. KG-D5 gas fields are viable at that price, he said. The 7,294.6 sq km deepsea KG-D5 block has been broadly categorised into Northern Discovery Area (NDA - 3,800.6 sq km) and Southern Discovery Area (SDA - 3,494 sq km). The NDA has 11 oil and gas discoveries while SDA has the nation's only ultra-deepsea gas find of UD-1. These finds have been clubbed in three groups - Cluster-1, Cluster-II and Cluster-III. Gas discovery in Cluster-I is to be tied up with finds in neighbouring G-4 block for production but this is not being taken up currently because of a dispute with RIL over migration of gas from ONGC blocks, the official said. From Cluster-II a peak oil output of 77,305 barrels per day is envisaged within two years of start of production. Gas output is slated to peak to 16.56 million standard cubic meters per day by end-2021. Cluster-2A mainly comprises of oil finds of A2, P1, M3, M1 and G-2-2 in NDA which can produce 77,305 bpd (3.86 million tonnes per annum) and 3.81 mmscmd of gas. Cluster 2B, which is made up of four gas finds -- R1, U3, U1, and A1 in NDA -- envisages a peak output of 12.75 mmscmd of gas, the official said, adding that peak output is likely to last 7 years. Cluster-3 is the UD-1 gas discovery in SDA in ultra deepsea that poses technological challenges.","Business, DGH, Directorate General of Hydrocarbons, investing, KG-D5, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, PTI",PTI,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-awaits-dgh-nod-for-365-billion-kg-d5-gas-development-plan_8096481.html

It will take around a year to prepare the facility. By 2017, we will roll out the Agartala Basin,&amp;quot; Mahawar said.","State-run energy behemoth ONGC will set up a new 'basin' in Agartala by the end of next year as it looks to focus more on exploration of oil and gas in the North-East region. &amp;quot;We are discussing about setting up a 'basin' in Agartala. Director of Exploration and I visited Agartala around five months ago. We checked the facilities. Currently work for creation of workstation is going on,&amp;quot; ONGC Director (Onshore) Ved Prakash Mahawar told PTI. Construction work is going on as earlier there was no proper building to start functioning of a 'basin' in Agartala, he added. &amp;quot;A 'basin' receives huge amount of data, which are processed subsequently. It will take around a year to prepare the facility. By 2017, we will roll out the Agartala Basin,&amp;quot; Mahawar said. ONGC's North East operations are divided into two areas -- Assam Shelf from Jorhat to Duliajan and Assam Fold Belt from Silchar to Agartala. While exploration is being done only by Assam-Arakan 'basin' based at Jorhat, the production is divided by three 'assets' -- Assam Asset at Nazira, Jorhat Asset at Jorhat and Tripura Asset at Agartala. Basin's job is to discover or explore oil and gas, but it does not produce anything. On the other hand, an 'asset' exploits or produces and sends products to refineries. Explaining the rationale behind creating a new 'basin', the senior official said: &amp;quot;The Assam Fold Belt is a complex and a complicated one. Sometimes we get minerals and other things. We want an experienced person there who knows about it. This will bring in focus to that area. As it is a difficult area, so we want to treat it differently.&amp;quot; Assam Fold Belt has mainly gas, while there are both oil and gas in Assam Shelf, he added. Mahawar said the new 'basin' is being created to focus more on exploration of energy sources in the area. When asked about the manpower in the upcoming Agartala 'basin', he said: &amp;quot;In a basin, mostly scientists are there. In Jorhat 'basin', 300 people are there. So usually, around 200- 300 people are there in a 'basin'. But Agartala will house 50 -60 people only as finance, HR and few other departments in Jorhat will be shared with it.&amp;quot; Before creating an 'asset' in Jorhat, it was only a 'basin' with a daily production of 350 tonnes. &amp;quot;Now we have made an 'asset' in Jorhat to focus on the production. An Executive Director sits there. As soon as it was made an 'asset', production has gone up to 400 tons every day. This will increase to 500 tonnes per day next year,&amp;quot; Mahawar said. In last fiscal, ONGC production in Assam was 0.9 million tonnes and this year, it is targetted to reach the figure of one million tonnes.","Agartala, Business, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Agartala",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-to-roll-out-new-basinagartala-by-2017_8096421.html

According to the proposal, wells would be drilled in blocks CB-CNN-2010/1, 6 and 9, which were awarded to ONGC way back in March 2012 through the NELP-9 bidding process. The petroleum exploratory licence to start the activities as per the production sharing contract (PSC) was granted in February 2013. The initial contract period is seven years. &amp;quot;Based on the views of the expert appraisal committee (EAC), the Union environment ministry has given environmental clearance to the ONGC drilling project in Gujarat subject to strict compliance of specific and general conditions,&amp;quot; a senior government official said. The clearance has been granted only for exploratory drilling of 22 wells. In case development drilling is to be done in future, the company should take prior clearance from the ministry, the official said. The total cost of the project is Rs 350 crore. Each well will be drilled up to a depth of 3,000 metres. Among conditions specified, the company has been asked to prepare an oil spillage prevention scheme and comply with the guidelines of disposal of solid waste, drill cutting and drilling fluids for onshore drilling operations. The company has been asked to take necessary measures to prevent fire hazards, containing oil spill and soil remediation as needed. On completion of drilling, the company has been asked to plug the drilled wells safely and obtain a certificate of environment safety from the authority concerned. ONGC is engaged in hydrocarbon exploration and production activities in about 26 sedimentary basins of India, owns and operates more than 11,000 kilometres of pipelines in India and contributes 80 per cent of the country's crude oil production.","ahmedabad, Banaskantha, Business, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Ahmedabad,Banaskantha",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-gets-green-nod-for-rs-350-cr-drilling-projectgujarat_6141601.html

In our view, the capex remains in line with our overall projections as the company will be completing some of its existing projects like Daman and Vashista,&amp;quot; it said. The benefit of new production from KG basin will only accrue starting fiscal 2020. &amp;quot;The company's announcement is also in line with our earlier expectation that the government's acceptance of a higher gas price for deep water blocks would result in additional investment in the oil and gas sector in India,&amp;quot; S&amp;amp;amp;P said in a statement. S&amp;amp;amp;P said its corporate credit rating on ONGC continues to be constrained by the sovereign credit rating on India (BBB-/Stable/A-3). S&amp;amp;amp;P has rated ONGC as 'BBB-' with stable outlook. A 'BBB' rating exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation, according to S&amp;amp;amp;P's rating definitions. &amp;quot;The rating on ONCG still has significant headroom as it will only come under pressure if we lower the SACP by five notches to 'bb' from 'a-'. This headroom reflects the very strong link of ONGC with the Indian government,&amp;quot; it said. S&amp;amp;amp;P said ONGC's SACP has very little headroom. &amp;quot;We currently expect ONGC's ratio of funds from operations (FFO) to debt to be about 35 percent for the next two years after factoring the acquisition of 15 percent stake in Vankor oil field in Russia for about USD 1.3 billion.

Expecting a slow recovery in oil prices over the next several years, the report said the drop in oil prices and weak natural gas prices have caused a fundamental change in the energy industry, and the sector's ability to generate cash flow has fallen substantially. &amp;quot;Moody's believes this situation will persist over several years. As a result, Moody's is recalibrating the ratings of many energy companies to reflect this industry shift,&amp;quot; the rating agency said in a statement. It confirmed ratings of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd but warned that the &amp;quot;ratings could come under pressure if oil prices fall more sharply than Moody's expects and the companies cannot reduce their capex and dividends correspondingly&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;The ratings could also come under further pressure if the companies pursue a more aggressive --&amp;amp;nbsp;either organic or inorganic --&amp;amp;nbsp;growth strategy, and/or higher shareholder returns,&amp;quot; it said. The drop in energy prices and corresponding capital market concerns will also raise financing costs and increase refinancing risks for exploration and production companies. However, the impact of the drop in oil prices and low natural gas prices will vary substantially from issuer to issuer depending on their production mix between oil and natural gas, the ability to reduce lifting cost and operating expenditure, the flexibility to reduce capital expenditure without affecting production levels, reserve replenishment needs and the expected deterioration of the companies' financial profiles relative to its ratings. National oil companies &amp;quot;went into the downturn with relatively low leverage and continue to maintain strong liquidity levels and access to the capital markets, it said.","Business, debt, Moody's credit rating, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Oil India, oil price, recovery","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Oil India,oil price,recovery,Moody's credit rating,debt",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/oil-price-recovery-poses-downgrade-risk-to-oil-ongc-moodys_5919181.html

2016-03-17T11:34:28+05:30,ONGC,Faizan Javed,ONGC eyes tie-up with foreign service providers to boost output,"Under the terms of the tie-up being discussed, firms such as Schlumberger NV and Halliburton Co will invest capital and share technical expertise in stagnant but producing ONGC hydrocarbon fields, DK Sarraf told Reuters.","State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd, India's biggest explorer, plans to enter into partnerships with overseas oilfield service providers to boost output from ageing oil and gas fields, its chairman said. Under the terms of the tie-up being discussed, firms such as Schlumberger NV and Halliburton Co will invest capital and share technical expertise in stagnant but producing ONGC hydrocarbon fields, DK Sarraf told Reuters. If the foreign partners are able to increase output, they will be paid a pre-determined fee on each additional barrel of crude oil produced, making it the first time India has adopted this kind of agreement, he said. ONGC, which accounts for half of India's total oil and gas production, has often been criticised by investors for failing to arrest a steady decline in its output. Most of its major fields are more than 25 years old. India imports almost 77 percent of its total crude oil requirement and the government is pushing to reduce crude oil and natural gas imports to between 65 and 67 percent in the next six years. Global oilfield service providers are looking for orders from India as drilling and exploration contracts elsewhere in the world are fast drying up following a plunge in oil prices. &amp;quot;In this low crude oil regime, we have decided to take advantage of the lower cost of services to enhance our capacity,&amp;quot; Sarraf said. Despite a 60 percent fall in global crude oil prices in the past year-and-a-half, ONGC has maintained its capital spending and has spent about USD4.5 billion so far in the current fiscal year to end-March to bolster production. Besides Schlumberger and Halliburton, ONGC is in talks with Weatherford International and Baker Hughes Inc., among others, Sarraf said. Schlumberger declined to comment. Halliburton, Weatherford and Baker Hughes did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Sarraf said ONGC is working to identify fields where output has come to a standstill after years of operation, but which the service providers see as offering potential. Partnerships are being considered for assets such as the Mehsana field in the western state of Gujarat and ONGC's oldest asset in eastern Assam state, said an ONGC executive who did not wish to be named. Sarraf declined to comment on the timeline for signing the partnerships.","Business, DK Sarraf, Global crude, Mehsana field, oil and gas, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,DK Sarraf,oil and gas,Mehsana field,global crude",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-eyes-tie-upforeign-service-providers-to-boost-output_5912521.html

Speaking to reporters after the signing of the agreement, he said the pacts &amp;quot;allow India partners to participate in Rusian upstream sector, whilst opening the growing India market to Rosneft&amp;quot;. While the IOC-OIL-Bharat PetroResources deal for 29.9 per cent stake in Tass-Yuriakh oilfield is a concluded agreement, the consortium's Vankor deal is an initial pact and a sale purchase agreement is yet to be concluded.

Essar Oil and Premier Oil of UK was awarded the Ratna and R-Series oil and gas fields, lying 130 km off the Mumbai coast, in December 1996 but the production sharing contract (PSC) could not be signed due to differences of rates of royalty and other issues. In 2010, the oil ministry had terminated the contract with Canaro as the Canadian company had not taken the government's consent to sell its controlling stake in the Amguri field and raise Rs 430 crore from Barbados-based Mass Financial Corp. &amp;quot;The fields have been decided to be reverted to original license holder, ONGC,&amp;quot; Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said. The Ratna and R-series oil fields hold an estimated 87 million barrels of oil and 1.2 billion cubic metres of gas reserves. The medium-sized Ratna and R-Series (R&amp;amp;amp;RS) fields have been languishing since 1993 when the then P V Narasimha Rao-led Congress government decided to invite bids.

These facilities were used by the company for production since 1983 before production was stopped in September 1994 after the field was put up for auction.

NTS held 20 meetings between November 1999 and June 2013 and kept setting targets for completion of negotiations and signing of production sharing contract (PSC), but it could not stick to its own targets for completion of the negotiations. CCEA has decided to revert the fields back to ONGC, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told PTI. ONGC had discovered the fields and created facilities in Ratna R-12, which is part of R&amp;amp;amp;RS, at a cost of Rs 472.55 crore. These facilities were used by the company for production since 1983 before production was stopped in September 1994 after the field was put up for auction. These facilities have been deteriorating as a result of 'plundering and looting' of platform utilities and equipment. The estimated repair cost for the existing facilities would be Rs 1,085.70 crore. CCEA had on March 9, 1999 approved freezing of the rates of levy of royalty and cess prevailing at the time of the bidding (Rs 900 per tonne as cess and Rs 528 per tonne as royalty). NTS in April 2005 wanted payment of statutory levies at current rates rather than those prevailing in 1995. Essar Oil and partners did not agree. The Attorney General concurred that PSC can be signed with old royalty rates. A note was sent to CCEA in January 2008 and resubmitted in June 2008, but the Cabinet Secretariat returned seeking certain modifications/corrections on some deficiencies. Another note was sent to CCEA on July 9, 2008, but the matter was re-examined by the Oil Ministry and it was decided that NTS should consider the matter once again with a view to analysing in detail the various alternatives available along with their financial implications. Thereafter, no final decision was taken.","Business, Cabinet, gas, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, ONGC","Cabinet,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,ONGC,Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan,gas",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cabinet-returns-ratnar-series-gas-fields-to-ongc_5836221.html

The state-of-the-art institute, to be set up on eight acres in Ettumanoor in Kottayam district, will focus on the hydrocarbon sector and overseas placements. State Labour and Skill Development additional chief secretary Tom Jose and BPCL Executive Director (Kochi Refinery) Prasad K Panicker signed an MoU in this regard in a function here today. &amp;quot;The focus area of the new SDI will be hydrocarbon sector and overseas employment. The syllabus and duration of the course and modalities for recruitment are yet to be decided,&amp;quot; Panicker said. &amp;quot;We will soon meet the labour department and Kerala Academy for Skills Excellence (KASE) officials to finalise this,&amp;quot; he said. BPCL has envisaged the SDI in Kerala as part of the decision of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to set up skill development institutes in various parts of the country to bring out the best of the youth and enhance their employability in the oil and gas industry and other sectors. Under the plan, each major oil and natural gas public sector undertakings, including IOCL, ONGC, BPCL, HPCL, OIL and GAIL volunteered to set up on skill development institutes and BPCL selected Kerala for this. A society of the PSUs would be formed to run the institute and the cost would be shared among oil companies. &amp;quot;We approached the state government for adequate land to set up the institute and got eight acres of vacant land for the purpose at the ITI campus at Ettumanoor,&amp;quot; Panicker said. The proposed SDI would cater not only to oil, gas and petrochemical sector, but also to other possible industries in the region and abroad by providing skilled manpower, he said. &amp;quot;This will result in an overall skill upgradation and development of the youth of the region and will also enhance their employability and increase opportunities for them in various industries in India and abroad,&amp;quot; he said. Earlier, speaking at the function, Tom Jose said there should be a paradigm shift in the mindset of people towards skilled jobs, many of which are now better paying than traditional engineering jobs. State director of employment and training K Biju was also present during the function.","Bharat Petroleum Corporation, Business, GAIL India, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, Indian Oil Corporation, Kerala government, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, productivity","Productivity,Kerala Government,Bharat Petroleum Corporation,Indian Oil Corporation,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Hindustan Petroleum Corporation,GAIL India",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/kerala-govt-joins-bpcl-to-setskill-development-institute_5734761.html

With oil prices slumping to 12-year lows, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has begun cost controls as well as deferment of capital expenditure without adverse impact on operations. It has appointed McKinsey &amp;amp;amp; Company to suggest areas where cost can be cut and operating expenditure controlled, sources privy to the development said. The company has issued an office order stating that projection of prolonged soft prices will have adverse impact on its bottom-line and it was &amp;quot;imperative that due prudence is exercise while sanctioning all kinds of expenditure/ investments.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Cost control and efforts for cost reduction as well as deferment of capital expenditure without adverse impact on operations is expected from all concerned,&amp;quot; the order said. Issuing areas of immediate cost control, it called for avoiding travel and where absolutely necessary the number of officers and the duration of visit be kept to absolute minimum. Also, video conferencing facilities be used to reduce movement of officers. Proposals for participation in study tours, workshops, conferences and seminars abroad at company cost may not be entertained expect those which are fully funded by sponsoring agencies, it said. &amp;quot;Holding of meetings, conferences and seminars outside ONGC premises may be resorted to only if it is absolutely necessary,&amp;quot; the order said also asking officers to use vehicles judiciously and avoid wasteful expenditure. &amp;quot;Expenditure on sponsorship, advertisements and on cultural programs may be curtailed,&amp;quot; it added. The company's cost of producing every barrel of crude oil is USD 36 and after including return on investment as well as taxes and levies, the cost comes to USD 51.52 per barrel. The slump in oil prices to 12-year low will means that ONGC pays less royalty and assuming the government lowers its Rs 4,500 per tons burden of cess, the cost of production will come to about USD 30 per barrel. This compares to realisation of USD 30-32 per barrel in the current quarter, just about squaring off the cost. Sources said the company has already initiated measures to cut avoidable expenditure and is putting money only in priority tasks or activities needed to sustain its oil and gas exploration and production. There will be no cut in capital expenditure in oil and gas projects as such investment will help the company sustain or increase output, they said.","advertisements, Business, Global oil prices, McKinsey & Company, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,advertisements,global oil prices,McKinsey &amp;amp; Company",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-to-trim-expenses-as-oil-prices-slump_5477641.html
2016-02-13T12:46:04+05:30,ONGC,Faizan Javed,MRPL back in black with Rs 298 crore profit in Dec quarter,The firm earned USD 8.4 on turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel in third quarter of current fiscal as compared to USD 6.74 a barrel gross refining margin in the year-ago period.,"Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) returned to black with a net profit of Rs 298 crore in the December quarter on the back of robust refining margins. MRPL, a subsidiary of Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), had a net loss of Rs 1,894 crore in October-December 2014, the company said in a statement. The firm earned USD 8.4 on turning every barrel of crude oil into fuel in third quarter of current fiscal as compared to USD 6.74 a barrel gross refining margin in the year-ago period. &amp;quot;The improvement in GRM is on account of products like pet coke and polypropylene generated out of the new Phase-III secondary units despite marginally lower throughput of 0.04 million tonnes on account of planned shutdown during the starting of third quarter,&amp;quot; it said. MRPL saw its inventory loss decline to Rs 666 crore in October-December from Rs 2,419 crore in third quarter of previous fiscal. Inventory loss occurs when a company buys crude oil at a particular price but by the time it ships it to India and processes it, its value would have declined because of falling global oil prices. The drop in oil prices also meant that the company turnover slips to Rs 11,193 crore from Rs 15,833 crore. &amp;quot;The reduction in gross revenue is mainly due to steep reduction in crude and product prices by around 33 percent in the reporting quarter compared to previous quarter prices,&amp;quot; the statement said. The refinery processed 3.82 million tonnes of crude oil in the quarter, almost unchanged from 3.86 million tonnes a year ago. &amp;quot;The deregulation of diesel pricing has opened up opportunities for recommencing the retail business. MRPL has drawn up plans for opening over 100 petrol pumps in the near short term,&amp;quot; the statement added.","Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals, net profit, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Results","Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals,net profit ,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/results/mrpl-backblackrs-298-crore-profitdec-quarter_5457561.html

From this platform, de-hydrated gas will be transferred to already existing onland terminal at Odalarevu, East Godavari district, by subsea pipeline. This pipeline will be connected directly to GAIL custody transfer point.From Cluster 2, the hydrocarbon fluids will be taken to an FPSO facility through dual subseas pipeline. The stablised crude oil will be transported through sea tankers and compressed and dehydrated gas will be evacuated on to fixed platform from FPSO to Odalarevu Onshore Terminal through dual subsea pipeline reaching the onland terminal to GAIL for custody transfer.The operational area in KG Basin, Rajahmundry, covers an area of 28,000 sq km onland and 1,45,000 sq km offshore, including deep waters. This is a unique basin in the sense that hydrocarbons have been discovered both in onland and offshore parts of the basin.","Andhra Pradesh, Business, environmental clearance, KG, Krishna-Godavari basin, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, ONGC","ONGC,environmental clearance,Krishna-Godavari basin,Andhra Pradesh,KG",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-gets-green-nod-for-kg-basin-infra-project_5140141.html

The memorandum of understanding (MoU) is part of efforts of Indian flagship overseas oil and gas firm to expand its presence in hydrocarbon rich African continent. The pact was signed by OVL Managing Director and CEO Narendra K Verma Eqatorial Guinea's Minister for Mines Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima yesterday on sidelines of the 4th India-Africa Hydrocarbons Summit here.  &amp;quot;Under the MOU, the State of Equatorial Guinea will cooperate with ONGC Videsh to explore the potential investment opportunities within the upstream hydrocarbons sector in Equatorial Guinea, as may be of interest to ONGC Videsh,&amp;quot; OVL said in a statement. OVL already has presence in Mozambique, Sudan and South Sudan in Africa. It is India's largest international oil and gas exploration and production company having 36 projects in 17 countries including Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Libya, Myanmar, Russia, Syria, Venezuela and Vietnam.  OVL's oil and gas operations produced 8.87 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas (mmtoe) in 2014-15. As on April 1, it had a total oil and gas reserves of 647.485 million metric tonne of oil equivalent (MMtoe). OVL's overseas cumulative investment up to March 31, 2015 has crossed USD 23.77 billion.

2016-01-21T12:56:29+05:30,ONGC,Faizan Javed,Sudan offers OVL 3 more oil &amp;amp; gas blocks for exploration,"The offer made by visiting Sudanese Oil Minister Mohamed Zayed Awad is part of the African nation's efforts to seek greater energy engagements with India, to which it owes USD 240 million in oil dues.","Sudan has offered ONGC Videsh Ltd three more oil and gas blocks for exploration and production and invited Indian firms to set up a coastal refinery to boost fuel supplies to the African continent. The offer made by visiting Sudanese Oil Minister Mohamed Zayed Awad is part of the African nation's efforts to seek greater energy engagements with India, to which it owes USD 240 million in oil dues. OVL, the overseas investment arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), already has a 25 percent stake in Greater Nile Oil Project (GNOP) in Sudan that produces about 50,000 barrels of oil per day. &amp;quot;They have offered more oil blocks for exploration and asked for Indian companies' expertise to raise production from existing fields,&amp;quot; Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said after meeting Awad on sidelines of the 4th India-Africa Hydrocarbons Conference here. Awad said Sudan has offered Blocks 8, 15 and 24 for exploration of oil and has asked OVL to consider buying a stake in producing Block 17. Block 17 currently produces 7,000 bpd of oil. Pradhan said Sudan is also keen on Indian firms setting up a coastal refinery to meet not just local fuel demand but also export to other African nations. &amp;quot;The issue of USD 240 million pending dues was also discussed and modalities are being worked out for that,&amp;quot; he said. Sudan has not paid OVL for the oil from GNOP it consumed. The cash-starved nation wants the Indian firm to raise output from the producing Block 17 and exploration areas offered and recoup the dues from it. Star Oil is the operator of Block 17 with 66 percent stake while the remaining is with Sudan's Sudapet. Also discussed was renewal of licence for Block 2B, which is part of GNOP. The licence for the block expires in November and OVL and its partners China National Petroleum Company (40 percent stake), Petronas of Malaysia (30 percent) and Sudapet (5 percent) want a 5-15 year extension. OVL had in 2003 bought 25 percent stake in GNOP which comprised of Block 1, 2 and 4 in the undivided Sudan. It lies in the prolific Muglad basin about 780 kms in the South-West of Khartoum, the capital of Sudan. Upon secession of South Sudan from Sudan, Blocks 2A, 2B and 4N are in Sudan and Blocks 1A, 1B as well as 4S are in South Sudan. Block 2B is producing 50,000 bpd of oil while Block 4 is under exploration phase. The crude oil produced from oil field of GNOP, is transported through a 1504-km pipeline to Port Sudan at Red Sea. Upon secession of South Sudan from Sudan in July 2011, the contract areas of Blocks 1, 2 and 4, spread over both the areas, were split with major share of production and reserves are now situated in the South Sudan. Post secession, as the government of Sudan's share of total production from Sudan was not sufficient to meet requirements of local refineries, foreign firms were asked to sell their share of crude oil to it. However, the payment of dues on account of crude oil purchased by government of Sudan has not been received, officials said, adding that OVL's share of the outstanding dues is about USD 240 million.  OVL's share of oil production from GNOP, Sudan, was 0.7 million tons in 2014-15. OVL had along with state-owned&amp;amp;nbsp;Oil India Ltd constructed and financed a 741-km multi-product pipeline from Khartoum refinery to Port Sudan for USD 194 million. OVL's share of project cost was 90 percent while the rest was borne by OIL.  The pipeline was handed over to government of Sudan in October 2005. The lump sum price, together with lease rent was to be given to OVL in 18 equal half yearly instalments effective from December 2005. While the payment of 11 half-yearly instalments due till December, 2010 was received from the government of Sudan, remaining seven instalments due from June 30, 2011 to June 30, 2014, are yet to be released.  OVL, whose share of investment in the project was USD 158.01 million, has been following up for realisation of USD 98.94 million from government of Sudan at various levels.","African nations, Business, Dharmendra Pradhan, fuel, gas, oil, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Oil India, Oil Minister Mohamed Zayed Awad, ONGC Videsh Ltd, Sudan","ONGC Videsh Ltd,Sudan,oil,gas,fuel,Oil Minister Mohamed Zayed Awad,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,Dharmendra Pradhan ,African nations",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sudan-offers-ovl-3-more-oilgas-blocks-for-exploration_5101861.html

2017-12-26T18:50:34+05:30,ONGC,Shishir Asthana,Big divestment targets will be a thing of the past post FY19 budget,It is advantageous for the government to push such deals rather than smaller divestments which barely yield meaningful money.,"Shishir Asthana Moneycontrol Research  Having exhausted its traditional method of generating revenue through stake sales, the government is increasingly seeking to raise funds through a complete takeover of companies within the same sector.  It is advantageous for the government to push such deals rather than smaller divestments which barely yield meaningful money. These strategic takeovers bring in lump sum as the company taking over has to pay the government the entire amount for its stake rather than a conventional way of the share swap.  Had a private sector player adopted such a route, shareholders would have raised corporate governance concerns. Few protest when public sector companies are taken over this way, despite the fact that non-promoter shareholders of the target companies do not benefit in any way.  Take the case of the recently announced takeover of ONGC and HPCL where the government gets around Rs 33,000 crore when ONGC buys out government&rsquo;s holding of HPCL. However, as per Sebi rules, government companies are exempted from making the offer open to if the ultimate ownership remains the same and the premium paid for the acquisition is less than 25 percent above the market value.  In many profit-making public sector companies, government stake has fallen over the years through successive divestments. Apart from the oil companies, there are few companies in the mining space like Coal India which can help the government raise big money for its divestment. Going forward, smaller divestments would not be enough to fill the high divestment targets that have been set over the last few years.  Divestment as a source of filling the budget deficit is likely to last a few more years as the government resorts to merging companies in the same sector.  The next big &lsquo;structured divestment&rsquo; will be in gas transportation giant GAIL India. Refiners Indian Oil Corporation and Bharat Petroleum Corp are keen to acquire gas utility GAIL that will help it integrate their operations. However, GAIL is keen on being picked up by ONGC, especially after it takes over HPCL.  This naturally makes more sense as the entire gamut of exploration, refining, and transportation will be covered by a single company thus capturing the entire value chain. The government's 54.89 percent stake in GAIL is currently worth about Rs 46,700 crore.  For the companies concerned, it makes sense that they are merged and integrated rather than being islands of growth. With the economy opening up and global players entering the country it makes sense to have strong integrated players.  However, this method of meeting the divestment target cannot last for long. Mainly because there are few companies, apart from the oil sector ones that have cash on their balance sheet or the borrowing power to acquire companies in the same sector.  What the trend suggests is the government is close to selling the last big pieces of family silver. Though it can still sell the stake in the merged entities the amount to be raised through them will be small. In short, going forward the divestment targets of the government will come down drastically. The only way to keep fiscal deficit under control will be through higher taxes.","Business, Companies, markets","takeover of companies,divestments,ONGC,HPCL,Sebi,Coal India,GAIL India,Indian Oil Corporation,Bharat Petroleum Corp,Budget 2019",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/big-divestment-targets-will-bethingthe-past-post-fy19-budget_10264201.html

The planned capex of Rs 2,000-2,500 crore will be for &amp;quot;drilling 144 new wells and laying internal pipelines&amp;quot; in GEECL's Raniganj block in West Bengal, he said here.  GEECL, the first to start coal-bed methane (CBM) production in India in 2007, produces 0.57 million standard cubic metres of gas a day at the Raniganj block.  &amp;quot;Eventually, it will rise to 2.5-3 mmscmd,&amp;quot; he said without giving timelines.  The company has so far drilled 156 wells on the block which has gas reserves of 2.6 trillion cubic feet in place, he said.  The government has so far awarded 33 blocks for extracting CBM but only three have started production so far. While GEECL has been producing CBM for 10 years now, Essar Oil last year produced about 9,00,000 cubic metres a day from another block in Raniganj, RG(E)-CBM-2001/1.  Reliance Industries (RIL) began gas production from its Sohagpur CBM blocks in Madhya Pradesh after winning extraction rights in 2002. State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has entered development phase in its four blocks including Raniganj (North).  GEECL produces CBM from Raniganj (South) licence area, which covers 210 square kilometres, with 2.62 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves in place.  It has taken government to arbitration over its second asset of Mannargudi licence situated in Tamil Nadu as it was unable to begin work due to local protests. The block covers an area of 667 sq km and 0.98 Tcf gas-in-place.  Modi said GEECL, which began looking at the Raniganj block in 1993, will continue to scout for opportunities to invest in the unconventional assets, including shale.  &amp;quot;We continue to look but nothing serious is on the horizon as of now,&amp;quot; he said.  The government is looking at raising share of natural gas in the energy mix to 15 per cent by 2020 from 6.5 per cent now, in a bid to cut use of polluting liquid hydrocarbon fuels.

2017-12-19T14:59:36+05:30,ONGC,PTI,Sell majority stake in PSUs to cut import bill: Vedanta to govt,The suggestion in the form of a full-page advertisement in national dailies came at a time oil regulator DGH has proposed to the petroleum ministry to sell 60 per cent stake in 15 producing oil and gas fields of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) to private firms.,"ining mogul Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Ltd has made a strong case for the government selling its majority stake in PSUs such as ONGC and Coal India or transferring their assets to private firms to cut import bill by at least 25 per cent.  The suggestion in the form of a full-page advertisement in national dailies came at a time oil regulator DGH has proposed to the petroleum ministry to sell 60 per cent stake in 15 producing oil and gas fields of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) to private firms.  Vedanta, which had acquired 51 per cent government stake in Bharat Aluminium Co (Balco) for Rs 551 crore in 2011 and 64 per cent in Hindustan Zinc Ltd for over Rs 750 crore in 2002- 03, said privatising mineral and hydrocarbon producing PSUs or their assets would lead to 10 times more production.  In the advertisement, the firm said: &amp;quot;India is a rich country yet poor.&amp;quot;  The &amp;quot;fastest&amp;quot; way to raise contribution of metals, minerals and oil and gas in India's GDP from 2 per cent to 7 per cent is &amp;quot;to bring private partners in all government companies such as Kolar, Coal India, Hindustan Copper, ONGC, NMDC and others, with majority stake in the company or at the asset level&amp;quot;.  Vedanta, which principally was a mining company, ventured into the oil and gas space in 2011 when it acquired Cairn India from its British promoters. While its mining acquisitions have been hugely successful as it turned around both Balco and HZL, its oil and gas business has not met with similar success.  Cairn India in 2012 produced 1,75,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil from Mangala and Bhagyam fields -- the two biggest fields in the prolific Rajasthan block -- and targeted 2,40,000 bpd with the addition of Aishwariya field in 2013.  Five years with Vedanta at the helm, the entire Rajasthan block accounted for 1,10,137 bpd of production at the end of 2016-17, according to a company statement of April 11.  &amp;quot;As proved in past, this (involving private sector) will lead to 10 times more jobs and 10 times more production with at least 25 per cent reduction in import bill. This can be achieved within two years without allowing any job losses,&amp;quot; Vedanta said in the full-page advertisement today.  To encourage employees, stock options of up to 5 per cent of equity capital can be offered to them, it said.  Vedanta also said the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act needs to be amended to make it more attractive.  &amp;quot;This requires immediate attention. It needs to be production oriented and targeted towards 30-40 per cent revenue sharing,&amp;quot; it said without elaborating.  It wants bauxite mines to be auctioned without delay as India has one of the highest mineral reserves. Also, the cap on iron ore production is expected to help realise Prime Minister's vision of producing 300 million tones of steel in India.  &amp;quot;India's geology is better or similar to Australia, South Africa and the Middle-East. With its tremendous human resource, India can produce these minerals using world-class technology with priority to safeguard our environment.  &amp;quot;This will save hard-earned forex and will create a separate revenue stream without putting an extra burden of tax. The wealth, thus saved, can be used for developing housing, education, healthcare and employment for all,&amp;quot; Vedanta added.","Banks, Business, Companies, PSU, Vedanta","Vedanta,business,companies,PSU,banks",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sell-majority-stakepsus-to-cut-import-bill-vedanta-to-govt_10237001.html

In para-wise comments on the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons' (DGH) proposal to auction 60 per cent stake in some producing oil and gas fields of ONGC and Oil India Ltd, ONGC said national oil companies (NOCs) should also be allowed to participate in the auction.  DGH has identified 15 discovered and producing fields - 11 of Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and four of Oil India Ltd - with a cumulative in-place reserve of 791.2 million tonnes of crude oil and 333.46 billion cubic metres of gas, for auctioning on the plea that private involvement will raise output.  The fields &amp;quot;may be offered to NOCs in case the NOC assures to raise the production by working out financial viability of the field with the extending of incentives like lesser royalty and no cess to the NOC&amp;quot;, ONGC said on the DGH's draft Production Enhancement Contract Policy.  DGH has in the policy proposed to auction the fields to the bidder who commits the maximum investment and pledges the largest share of its net revenue to the government.  The bidder, who would pay reduced royalty rates and be exempted from payment of oil cess and import duty on capital goods under the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP), would get 60 per cent equity in the field and receive 60 per cent of net proceeds from sales from the fourth year after production.  ONGC said the provision of the selected bidder getting a 60 per cent of net proceeds from sales should apply only when output rises above a predecided base profile.  ONGC said as per proposal, DGH shall invite bids from interested parties, evaluate and finalise the selection.  &amp;quot;The methodology proposed to finalise a private company does not foresee any role for ONGC,&amp;quot; it said demanding a leading role in defining bid evaluation criteria and bid evaluation.  &amp;quot;Alternatively, freedom to farm-in (take sake) may be given to ONGC itself,&amp;quot; the company said.  Also, the provision of reverting back the field to NOC may be made in the policy in case of non-performance by a selected partner, without any compensation, it said.  The firm also said it should be examined if the state governments would accept the reduction in royalty payment and no cess.  ONGC questioned DGH's mathematical formula which used indices like cut-off reserve volume, exploitation rate, current recovery rate and average production decline to identify the 15 fields.  Techno-commercial factors such as crude oil quality, its price, proximity to market, etc needed to be taken into account before handing over to the private players, it said.","Business, Companies, India","ONGC,DGH,oil and gas fields,national oil companies,Directorate General of Hydrocarbons,national oil companies,NOC,Production Enhancement Contract Policy,Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy,HELP",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-tears-into-dgh-proposal-to-sell-its-oil-gas-fields_10226481.html

2017-12-12T14:28:24+05:30,ONGC,PTI,ONGC seeks access to data room to fix HPCL acquisition price,"India's largest oil and gas producer has so far been given an information memorandum (IM) by government's transaction advisor which ONGC feels is not sufficient to arrive at a valuation of Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL), sources privy to the development said.","State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has sought access to a data room to help fix the price at which it can acquire government's 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL.  India's largest oil and gas producer has so far been given an information memorandum (IM) by government's transaction advisor which ONGC feels is not sufficient to arrive at a valuation of Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL), sources privy to the development said.  ONGC, they said, wants to better understand HPCL's financials, particularly the investments it has committed in projects like a greenfield refinery at Barmer in Rajasthan, before it embarks on buying the government stake which at today's price is worth over Rs 32,600 crore.  Sources said ONGC wants to do a proper due diligence on HPCL and access to data room is a prerequisite for that.  HPCL already has a data room and will give access to the same to ONGC if the seller (government) so desires, a company official said.  The official said the company has already shared information with government's transaction advisor and it is ready to share more if the need arises.  Previously, the government was of the view that ONGC should arrive at a valuation of HPCL based on the publicly available information. The bulk of IM is made up of publicly available information.  Sources said ONGC wants a better fix at the kind of money it will need to invest in HPCL post acquisition and so wants access to data room.  The Cabinet on July 19 approved the sale of government's entire 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL to ONGC as part of its Rs 72,500 crore disinvestment target for the current fiscal, 2017-18.  Transaction advisors were appointed in August and it was expected that an IM containing detailed information on HPCL's assets and liabilities would be handed over to ONGC by mid- September so as to help it firm up a value for the stake buy.  Originally, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), which is managing the sale, was keen to close the transaction in October or November itself but it managed to send the IM to ONGC only on October 31.  Sources said in a typical strategic stake sale, the government opens data room for potential acquirers to access information on the target company.  But in case of HPCL, this is being done on the basis of largely publicly known information that has been put in IM.  JM Financial is DIPAM's transaction advisor for the stake sale while Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas is the legal advisor.  With ONGC and HPCL under the administrative control of the oil ministry, the latter has appointed 'Protocol Valuers Ltd' for suggesting valuation at which the government's 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL should be sold to ONGC.  ONGC has appointed CitiGroup and SBI Caps as its transaction advisors.","Business, Companies, HPCL, oil, ONGC","ONGC,Oil,HPCL,business,companies",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-seeks-access-to-data-room-to-fix-hpcl-acquisition-price_10204741.html

Selling just 18 percent out of the government's 68.07 percent shareholding in Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) will fetch over Rs 41,000 crore at current market price, many times more than the investment commitment it may get from giving away 60 percent in 11 identified oil and gas fields of the company, they said.  Speaking to PTI on the condition of anonymity, a cross- section of ONGC employees, officials and executives expressed dismay at the move by Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) to handover 11 of the company's fields including Kalok, Ankleshwar, Gandhar and Santhal - the big four oilfields in Gujarat, to private sector on grounds of raising output. &amp;quot;If they think ONGC is inefficient, the company should be privatised.  The proposed approach will only drive the company, which is India's most profitable PSU, the Air India way,&amp;quot; one of them said. Cutting government stake to just one share less than 50 percent would give government enough revenues to meet its disinvestment target as well as bring in &amp;quot;an efficient private sector management&amp;quot;, he said.  India has 0.3 percent of world's oil and gas reserves but produces 0.6 percent of global output, with ONGC accounting for the bulk of it, another official said.  He sought to debunk the theory that since the recovery at the state-owned firm's fields is low, it warrants involvement of private sector in raising production. ONGC, officials said, has maintained production levels despite most of its prime fields being in production for decades and natural decline setting.  &amp;quot;Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan has been touting at public forums ONGC's 'stagnant' production being on the rise,&amp;quot; one of them said.  Another official said that if drop in production is a criterion for getting so-called experts for raising production, eastern offshore KG-D6 gas fields in Bay of Bengal and Barmer oilfields in Rajasthan are the fit case.  These fields are just 8-10 years old but have seen considerable drop in production, he added. Natural gas output from the biggest gas field in the KG- D6 block is one-tenth since global major BP Plc came on board nearly seven years back, he said.  Another official cited the example of Panna/Mukta and Tapti oil and gas fields in western offshore, which was taken away from ONGC in the 1990s and given to Enron Corp and Reliance Industries.  After Enron's bankruptcy, the fields were first operated by BG Group of UK and now under Royal Dutch Shell but the production has only fallen, leading to the partners deciding to relinquish one of the fields, he said.  The DGH wants private companies take 60 percent stake in producing oil and gas fields of national oil companies, ONGC and OIL, with the view that they would raise production above the baseline estimate. As many as 15 fields - 11 of ONGC and four of Oil India Ltd (OIL) - with a cumulative in place reserve of 791.2 million tonnes of crude oil and 333.46 billion cubic metres of gas have been identified.  Another executive said the concept of the fields being given to ONGC on nomination basis is &amp;quot;flawed&amp;quot; as what the company got was barren piece of area where it invested capital, without seeking any budgetary support, to discover oil and gas and produce from them.  And these areas were given to ONGC in absence of any private or foreign company interest in exploring in India, he pointed out. According to the proposal made by DGH, ONGC/OIL fields would be auctioned and any firm committing the maximum capital investment within 10 years of the contract award and the largest share out of its net revenue to the government would be awarded the field.  The 15 fields selected are out of a review of 202 fields operated by the national oil companies. The fields chosen are ones that hold reserves of 20 or more million tonnes of oil equivalent (MT OE) and have crossed the half-way mark on a score (indicative of poor field performance) combining exploration index, current recovery, and production decline rate in the last three years.  Of the 202 fields, 141 are either less than 10 years of age or had shown some positive change in the year-on-year production rate. As many as 44 fields of ONGC and OIL have been identified for production enhancement work through Technical Services Model. Under this, technical tie-ups would get the 'tariff' that they bid as a return for increasing the output 'over the baseline production' for 10 years initially.

The statement follows reports that US-based oil refineries are exporting pet coke -- a carbon-rich solid material derived from oil refining -- to India as there aren't many takers for it in their country.  &amp;quot;Recently the Supreme Court banned the use of pet coke in three states surrounding the Delhi-NCR. Consumption of pet coke is around 25 million tonnes in our country. Of this, around 13 million tonnes is produced by Indian refineries (rest is imported),&amp;quot; said Pradhan at a press conference here.  Asked about his plans for reducing the imports as well as use of pet coke, Pradhan said a policy is being framed by various stake-holder ministries to put curbs on its imports.  Pet coke does not cause pollution if it is used as fuel in certain industries such as cement production, the minister said.  &amp;quot;At present, ministry of petroleum along with ministries of environment, commerce and some other ministries are framing a policy to increase restrictions on imports of pet coke. We are planning to implement a system to stop imports and use home-produced pet coke for non-polluting sectors, such as cement production,&amp;quot; he said.  Giving details of ongoing work by ONGC in Kutch Offshore Basin, Pradhan said the basin, near the Gujarat coast, would produce nearly three million metric standard cubic meter per day of gas for the next 15 years.  &amp;quot;It is a significant discovery. ONGC is carrying out exploratory work in the basin for the last one year. This is a Rs 2,500 crore project, which would produce 3 MMCM per day for the next 15 years,&amp;quot; he said.","Business, India","Dharmendra Pradhan,Petroleum and Natural Gas,ONGC,Kutch Offshore Basin",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/soon-policy-to-restrict-pet-coke-imports-oil-minister_10156201.html

The Association of Scientific &amp;amp;amp; Technical Officers (ASTO) cited examples of falling production at the western offshore Panna/Mukta fields that were privatised in the 1990s, and Reliance Industries' flagging KG-D6 fields to state that ONGC has done well with its ageing fields.  Most oil and gas fields of ONGC have been in production for 30 years and output has naturally shown a dip from the peak level but still accounts for the bulk of domestic output, ASTO president Sanjay Goel wrote to Modi on November 23.  Oil Ministry has identified 15 producing oil and gas fields of ONGC and Oil India Ltd for handing over to private firms on the premise of raising output.  The fields have in-place reserve of 791.2 million tonnes of crude oil, and 333.46 billion cubic metres of gas have been identified.  Production trajectory at Panna-Mukta field, which was taken away from ONGC and privatised, has been on continuous decline, Goel wrote. &amp;quot;In fact, from 2009-10, production from the asset has dropped by close to 60 per cent,&amp;quot; he wrote.  Also, Ratna-R Series fields which were given to Essar Oil could not be brought to production in two decades and have now been reverted to ONGC.  &amp;quot;This clearly shows privatisation alone is not a sufficient condition for augmenting output from any hydrocarbon property,&amp;quot; he wrote.  He said if stagnant or flagging production is a criterion for identifying underperforming fields of ONGC, the same yardstick must be extended to all domestic fields.  &amp;quot;The production today at RIL operated KG-D6 is under 10 per cent of its targeted production. For a field that is less than 10 years into its lifecycle, this is a staggering drop on any count,&amp;quot; he said.  The production drop at KG-D6 to 5-6 million standard cubic meters per day has also had a collateral damage to stranded gas-based plants and other struggling industries.  &amp;quot;Compare that with the consistent gas supplies from our Bassein and Satellite Assets in western offshore - where production has averaged 30 mmscmd for the past 20 years at a stretch,&amp;quot; he wrote.  Even when prices have tipped, Goel said it is a misnomer that ONGC got everything on a platter by getting the blocks on the nomination. &amp;quot;ONGC, along with Oil India, was allotted those blocks at a time when there was hardly any private participation&amp;quot; and it invested heavily to discover the fields and produce from them.  &amp;quot;No private player ever has undertaken ventures of this kind since they are generally guided by a motive of profit in business,&amp;quot; he wrote.  He sought Modi's &amp;quot;personal intervention to stall the move to hand over existing legacy fields of ONGC to private players which will not only have a highly damaging implication for the nation but also adversely affect the motivation of employees who are committed to serving the national interests.&amp;quot;  Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is investing heavily in new technology and processes to improve recovery from the ageing fields, he said.  The company, he said, has never shied away from capital investment. Its capital outlay was not cut even when explorers worldwide froze fresh investment in view of the drop in prices.  &amp;quot;While all the private companies are geared towards maximising profit especially in a difficult market of low crude prices, ONGC is determined by maximising the recovery from its fields,&amp;quot; he wrote.","Business, Companies, Oil Minister, ONGC","ONGC,business,companies,Oil Minister",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-officers-seek-pm-intervention-to-stall-oil-min-move_10124041.html

The brokerage firm feels the risk reward remains favourable and capital efficiency is better across with costs falling.  &amp;quot;Oil around USD 60 per barrel is a sweet spot for both ONGC and Oil India with strong earnings and low subsidy risk in FY19,&amp;quot; the research house said while raising EPS estimates for ONGC/OIL for FY18/19 by 8/2 percent and 10/9 percent, respectively.  Every USD 10 a barrel increase in oil adds 22-28 percent to EBITDA and 20-30 percent to equity value of ONGC/Oil India.

2017-10-30T14:21:12+05:30,ONGC,PTI,HPCL buy to push ONGC's rating in upper limit: Moody's,The government's selling its 51.11 per cent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) to Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) will help it achieve the disinvestment target for the current fiscal.,"ONGC's planned acquisition of a majority stake in refiner HPCL will create India's first integrated oil and gas company but will cause the state-owned firm's leverage to approach the upper limit of its rating, Moody's Investors Service said today.  The government's selling its 51.11 per cent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) to Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) will help it achieve the disinvestment target for the current fiscal.  &amp;quot;The transaction also allows the government to monetise its HPCL ownership without losing ultimate control of the company,&amp;quot; Moody's said.  Based on HPCL's average market capitalisation over last three months, the government's stake is worth about Rs 35,000 crore, which ONGC may fund through borrowings of Rs 25,000 crore and the rest with cash on hand and the liquidation of investments.  Moody's said that post acquisition, it will assess ONGC's credit profile after full consolidation of HPCL.  &amp;quot;Post acquisition, ONGC's local currency rating will be a maximum of one notch higher than the sovereign's local currency rating. This will be driven by an increase in ONGC's exposure to domestic revenues through the refining and marketing business of HPCL,&amp;quot; it said in a note.  Also, the increase in ONGC's leverage from the acquisition will be seen as an indication of stronger government influence on the company's financial profile, it said, adding that the rating on foreign currency bonds will remain constrained by the Baa2 country ceiling for foreign currency bonds in India.  HPCL, it said, will remain strategically important to the government given its large-scale refining and marketing operations.  It will continue to be a state-owned entity and the government retains its ability to appoint all board directors.  The acquisition will create India's first integrated oil and gas company but benefits will be limited, Moody's said.  &amp;quot;Although the contribution of the downstream segment will increase and will result in lower volatility in earnings, the upstream segment will still account for 70 per cent of EBITDA.  &amp;quot;There will be some synergies but the benefits will be limited to the downstream segment, where there is an overlap between ONGC and HPCL's operations,&amp;quot; it said.  ONGC's refinery and petrochemical operations will be able to use HPCL's established marketing infrastructure, which will result in lower costs in those business segments.  Stating that ONGC's financial metrics will deteriorate post acquisition, Moody's said the state-owned firm's pro- forma leverage, as measured by retained cash flow (RCF)/net debt, would weaken to 33 per cent from 68 per cent and debt/ EBITDA will increase to 1.9x from 1.1x.  This leverage increase will be partly offset by a qualitative improvement in ONGC's business position as a vertically integrated company. &amp;quot;The pro-forma financial metrics of ONGC could still support its Baa1 rating,&amp;quot; it said.","Business, HPCL, Moodys, ONGC","ONGC,business,HPCL,Moody's",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/hpcl-buy-to-push-ongc39s-ratingupper-limit-moody39s_9942921.html

The NGO, in its plea, also sought cancellation of the appointment of Shashi Shanker as ONGC Chairman and Managing Director.  The public interest litigation (PIL) filed by NGO Energy Watchdog could not be taken up for hearing as the bench headed by Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal did not assemble today.  The matter has been fixed for hearing on November 1.  The PIL was filed through advocate Prashant Bhushan, who alleged that Patra, being an active member of the ruling BJP, &amp;quot;cannot play the role of an Independent Director or non- official director (NOD) in ONGC as it would be a violation of the Companies Act.&amp;quot;  The plea claimed that the selection process was also &amp;quot;flawed&amp;quot; as the BJP leader's name did not appear in the data bank of eligible persons for the post.  &amp;quot;State largesse cannot be passed on to a private political person in this manner,&amp;quot; it claimed.  Efforts to reach Patra for his comments on the issue did not fructify.  Opposing Shanker's appointment, the NGO has contended that he was suspended in February 2015 by the vigilance department of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas for alleged &amp;quot;gross misconduct&amp;quot; in connection with a tender matter while he was Director (Technology and Field Services) in ONGC.  However, his suspension was revoked in July 2015 citing the Supreme Court's general observation that a suspended officer should be reinstated if an agency fails to file a chargesheet within 90 days, the plea said.  The petition has sought setting aside of the September 25 and September 29 orders appointing Shanker and Patra respectively to the ONGC board.  The NGO has sought directions to the Centre and the Central Vigilance Department to produce the records they have in connection with the suspension of Shanker.  It has also sought the grades awarded to Shanker and Patra by the Public Enterprises Selection Board which had interviewed them for the posts.","Business, Companies, Current Affairs, ONGC","ONGC,ONGC news,ONGC news today,ONGC news latest,ONGC latest updates,ONGC Sambit Patra",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/sambit-patra39s-appointment-to-ongc-board-challengedhc_9911421.html

The proposal is to set up a seawater desalination plant with a capacity to process 20 million litres per day (MLD). The proposed site is about 380 meters away from the high tide line (HTL) of Arabian Sea, along the western coast of India.  Desalination is a process to remove dissolved minerals from feed water sources such as seawater and brackish water. Desalination of seawater is being increasingly adopted worldwide to cope with the deficit in availability of potable water.  In the letter, the environment ministry said it has given the CRZ clearance for establishing a desalination plant in Maharashtra after taking into account the recommendation of its expert panel.  The approval is subject to compliance of certain conditions such as obtaining of 'no objection certificate' from Maharashtra Pollution Control Board for discharge of brine water into the sea after necessary safeguards, it said.  The proposed desalination plant will be set up within the gas processing facility of ONGC Uran. About 8,750 square meter area has been earmarked for this purpose. The cost of the project is estimated at Rs 266.40 crore.  According to ONGC, the proposed project will cater process water and drinking water to the tune of 18 MLD and 2 MLD, respectively. It will help the company reduce its dependence on the State Water Supply Board.  Exploration giant ONGC contributes 72 percent to the country's total crude oil production and 48 percent of natural gas.

On a standalone basis we are debt free and so we can borrow from the market. Also, we have certain investments (in other oil companies) which can be sold,&amp;quot; he told reporters last night.  The company's shareholders yesterday allowed it to raise up to Rs 25,000 crore debt, he said, adding that the company had about Rs 10,000 crore of cash in hand.  &amp;quot;We haven't decided what will be the source of fund (for the acquisition). It can be one of the options or a combination of them. Funding is certainly no difficulty,&amp;quot; he said.  The government's transaction advisor JM Financial and legal consultant Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas are preparing Information Memorandum (IM) on Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL).  ONGC has appointed SBI Caps and the Citi Group as its merchant bankers for the deal and Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas as legal advisor, who would study the IM to arrive at a valuation for the takeover of the country's third-largest refining and oil marketing company.  &amp;quot;As a buyer we would like to have the lowest valuation while the government as a seller would like to get the maximum value. But since HPCL is a listed company with a market float of 49 per cent that is widely spread, there need not be a significant difference between what we need to pay and the market price,&amp;quot; Sarraf said.  The deal, he said, was likely to conclude by December.  He ruled out making an open offer to minority shareholders of HPCL post acquiring government's 51.11 per cent stake.  &amp;quot;There is no change of management and we have been advised that there is no requirement of an open offer,&amp;quot; he said.  The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had on July 19 granted 'in-principle' approval to the strategic sale of the government's existing 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL to ONGC &amp;quot;along with the transfer of management control, which will result in HPCL becoming a subsidiary company of ONGC&amp;quot;.

Though the government is cashing out on its holding, the amended terms make it clear that it will continue to retain control of HPCL.  Listing out rationale for the acquisition, Sarraf said integrated oil companies are the norm world over as they help balance upstream oil and gas production risks with downstream refining and marketing.  During high oil prices, upstream gains while downstream loses on margins. In an inverse scenario of low oil prices, downstream gains and upstream loses.  ONGC already has a subsidiary in Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL), which operates a 15 million tons a year refinery. HPCL owns 16.96 per cent stake in MRPL while ONGC has 71.63 per cent.

2017-09-26T14:03:14+05:30,ONGC,Faizan Javed,Shashi Shanker appointed ONGC Chairman,"The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) named Shanker, who is currently Director (Technical and Field Services) at ONGC, as CMD till his superannuation, as against an initial one-year term proposed by the Oil Ministry.","Shashi Shanker has been appointed Chairman and Managing Director of India's biggest oil and gas producer, ONGC, till March 2021.  The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) named Shanker, who is currently Director (Technical and Field Services) at ONGC, as CMD till his superannuation, as against an initial one-year term proposed by the Oil Ministry.  The ministry had, in a departure from past norms and guidelines, earlier this month recommended to the ACC that Shanker be appointed for an initial one-year term instead of the usual five-year period, sources in the know of the development said.  During this one-year term, his performance was proposed to be reviewed every quarter instead of the current practice of review after one year, they said.  ACC, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, however, appointed Shanker as Chairman and Managing Director of ONGC &amp;quot;till the date of his superannuation or until further orders, whichever is earlier&amp;quot;, an official order issued last evening said.  Shanker, 56, will take charge from October 1 when the incumbent Dinesh K Sarraf retires and will have a three-and- a-half-year term until March 31, 2021.  Reached for comments, a top oil ministry official, refusing to be identified, said, &amp;quot;all that matters is what is the appointment terms. What we said or did not say are irrelevant&amp;quot;.  Sources said government headhunters Public Enterprise Selection Board (PESB) had after interviewing nine candidates on June 19 recommended Shanker for the ONGC top job.  Anti-corruption watchdog CVC cleared his appointment last month. More than a month later, the ministry cited exploration challenges facing ONGC in raising crude oil and natural gas output in seeking a year's validity for Shanker's appointment.  During this one year initial period, his performance was proposed to be reviewed on a quarterly basis before seeking fresh ACC mandate for further employment, sources said.  ONGC's crude oil production was 22.56 million tons in 2012-13, which dipped to 22.25 million tons in the following year before rising marginally to 22.26 million tons in 2014-15 and 22.36 million tons in 2015-16. It dipped again to 22.25 million tons in 2016-17.  Sarraf, who took over as the Chairman of ONGC on March 1, 2014, has been shortlisted to head the downstream oil regulator, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB).  Established norms and PESB rules state that a board-level functionary would be considered for appointment for a period of five years or until the age of superannuation, whichever is earlier, with a provision that he/she would be assessed by the administrative ministry after the first year of his employment.  After yesterday's order, Shanker's performance would now be reviewed after one year and the ministry would seek confirmation for the balance tenure.  The Oil Ministry had in February 2015 suspended Shanker following allegations of irregularities in a tender for buying 21 Blowout Preventers (BOP).  The suspension, which was handed over without giving any showcase, was set aside after CVC found no wrongdoing on his part. He was reinstated in July that year with orders that said that the period of suspension be treated as his being on service.  No chargesheet was filed against him within the stipulated 90 days.  Shanker was the youngest director on the board of the nation's most profitable oil company when he was appointed Director (Technology and Field Services) on December 1, 2012. He was just 51 years old then.  ONGC board has seven full-time directors including the Chairman and Managing Director. While Sarraf retires on September 30, Director (Finance) A K Srinivasan would retire on October 31. Director (Offshore) T K Sengupta retires on December 31, followed by Director (Onshore) V P Mahawar in February 2018 and Director (HR) D D Misra in July next year.","Business, Companies, ONGC, Shashi Shanker","Shashi Shanker,ONGC,business,companies",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/shashi-shanker-appointed-ongc-chairman_9757941.html
2017-09-26T12:29:55+05:30,ONGC,Mitali Mohite,Government appointed advisors to decide on valuations of company: HPCL,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will acquire Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) later this year in a block deal at the prevailing market price and that would happen at some point during October or November.,"Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will acquire Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) later this year in a block deal at the prevailing market price and that would happen at some point during October or November.  In an interview to CNBC-TV18, MK Surana, CMD of HPCL spoke about what does this mean for the company.  Surana said one of the methodologies of evaluation can be on basis of market price.  He further said that government has appointed advisors to decide on the valuations of the company.  When asked about open offer, he said open offer is to be made by the buyer. As far as the company is concerned, we (HPCL) are not required to take any action on that except for what is required as per Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and Companies Act, he added.  Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview:  Anuj: Last time when we spoke to you, you had pointed out that HPCL has its own assets, HPCL has its own triggers and market price is not the best way to look at transfer of ownership from government to ONGC. Now we believe it will happen via block deal. Does that mean that there is no independent valuation for HPCL?  A: I had said last time that there are various methods to evaluate a company. Market valuation or the share price maybe one of the thing but there are number of other methodologies and evaluation is done based on the combination or the best of various methodologies which are possible. The block deal or the bulk deal is a methodology to executive those deals. As far as my understanding is concerned, of course it depends between the buyer and seller to arrive at the price which is acceptable to both of them and depending on what the buyer consider is the right price and what the seller consider is the right price.  We suggest that evaluation is not to be done. Government has appointed the advisors and they are doing their job as of today to evaluate the company and in that case after evaluation whether the market price is reflecting that or not that will be arrived at after that and then what should be the methodology to execute the deal that is to be decided between the buyer and the seller.  Anuj: The report said that the bulk deal will be done at the prevailing market price and the bulk deal and block deal also have formulas depending on the market price. So there cannot be too much premium though the prevailing market price or the current market price?  A: There are certain guidelines in the Sebi takeover code when the majority of the stakes are getting transferred which is 26 days average, 6 months average etc. So as far as the block deal or bulk deal, which happens, they are at the prevailing prices on that day. So independently the relation process is on and I do not have any input to suggest or to assume that that process is changed. So advisors have been appointed, they are doing their jobs and after that whatever evaluation methodology they adopt and the valuation they find then compared to market price, how it stacks at that point of time and that would decide the method of executing the deal. So as of today for me it's premature to comment whether it is a block or bulk deal  Latha: That means you are denying that it is going to be a market related pricing. You are saying it will be an independent valuer decided pricing?  A: I am not denying that it need not be market determined or something. What I said is the government has appointed evaluation advisors and they are doing their job and after they complete their exercise one of the methodologies can be the market price but that can be one of the ways to do it but that does not mean that is the only ways to do it and after they decide and they come back with valuation then it decide whether the market value is reflecting that price and then the methodology of execution the deal can be decided. This is my understanding of the whole issue. Of course it has to be decided between the buyer and the seller.  Anuj: But personally are you a bit disappointed. Would you have wanted this valuation report to come out first and then maybe the announcement that the deal would happen via the bulk deal window?  A: I do not think there is any announcement to that effect at least I am not aware that whether there is an announcement to that effect.  Anuj: There is a Press Trust of India (PTI) copy which is saying that it is going to happen via block deal?  A: Yes but they are talking about the execution methodology, but unless the evaluation exercise is over I won't be able to suggest or comment that this will be the way.  Surabhi: The same report is also talking about whether there is going to be an exception which means the buyer will not have to deal with an additional open offer because that makes the cost far more substantial for the buyer. Are you aware of any sort of communication with this regard that certain perhaps legalities within the Companies Act could be looked at to ensure that there is no need for an open offer?  A: The open offer is to be made by the buyers. As far as the company is concerned, we are not required to take any actions on that except for what is required as per Sebi and Companies Act.  As of today there is no additional input to suggest either way to us. Only because of the open offer is to be done or not done - that is the way it should be block deal. There is nothing like that. And even if the exemption is to be taken, there are provisions to that fact.  Anuj: Marketing margins - that has been an issue of debate. Where has it settled? Has it settled a bit lower over the last couple of fortnight? Has there been a bit of directive from the government to reduce the marketing margins? I think it was Rs 4-4.5 for petrol and it is settled at Rs 2.5-2.7 over the last three or four days looking at the Indian Oil Corporation's (IOC) website and I am assuming that it would be similar for you?  A: As far as domestic prices are concerned, they are day-to-day basis being decided by the oil marketing companies (OMCs) based on the international prices and the moment and accordingly the domestic prices have been declared on everyday basis since the time the daily pricing has been implemented. So sometimes you may see the marketing margins a bit more or a bit less.  Anuj: A bit more or less is fine but the point I am asking is has it been significantly lower over the last four-five days compared to previously?  A: You should not be judging by day-to-day basis also - that part. If it is lower, you all should be happy.  Latha: I am asking you if margins have fallen by design since there is a good 2 percentage point difference from what we saw two weeks ago.  A: No. It will also depend on some other factors apart from what you will see. Just the difference between the refinery transfer price (RTP) -- probably the way you people look at it; it is the total selling price minus the RTP minus taxation. As far as total marketing margin and expenses are concerned, it will also depend on procurements been sold on which date. So there will be a bit of variation to up or down to that extent on day-to-day basis, but on a longer term basis I wouldn't say there is much of a difference between the average marketing margins which we get....  Latha: No directive at all from the government that the consumer should be spared a little of the rise in both crude and the depreciation in the rupee. No directive at all. You will continue to price it higher?  A: There are two parts to it. As far as crude prices and the rupee exchange rate is concerned, that may determine the RTP part of it. As far as RTP is concerned, it is not purely guided by the cost of the crude and exchange rate and it is not built-up on cost of crude plus expenses in refining. It is based on the international pricing of the products. International prices of the products need not necessarily move exactly in tandem with the crude prices. It also depends on the crass, for example crass has softened a bit in last two-three days, from USD 15 or so on gasoline it has come down to USD 13. So the prices of the products may have slight variations to the crude prices and we should not directly correlate to that - that's one. Second, there is a time cycle between the crude is procured and products are refined and supplied. So there maybe impact of time also to that effect.","Business, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL), Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC)","MK Surana,CMD,HPCL,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,ONGC,valuations,deal",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/government-appointed-advisors-to-decidevaluationscompany-hpcl_9757061.html
2017-09-25T14:00:13+05:30,ONGC,Faizan Javed,ONGC to acquire HPCL in bulk or block deal in November-December,"While the government is keen that the deal, which would fetch it over Rs 33,000 crore at the current market price, is done in October, ONGC wants time to raise the money required for the acquisition, a senior government official said.","State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will acquire the government's 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL through a bulk or block deal some time in November or December at the prevailing market price.  While the government is keen that the deal, which would fetch it over Rs 33,000 crore at the current market price, is done in October, ONGC wants time to raise the money required for the acquisition, a senior government official said.  The government's transaction advisor JM Financial and legal consultant Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas is preparing Information Memorandum (IM) on Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) with India's largest oil and gas producer, ONGC, in the next 7-10 days.  ONGC has appointed SBI Caps and the Citi Group as its merchant bankers for the deal and Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas as legal advisor, who would study the IM to arrive at a valuation for the takeover of the country's third-largest refining and oil marketing company.  The official said ONGC will do the due diligence of HPCL's assets based on the IM and publicly available information to arrive at the valuation. Negotiations between ONGC and the government will follow if the valuation is vastly different from the one the government has arrived at.  The share purchase would happen through a bulk or block deal at the prevailing market price, he said, adding that going by the pace of things, the deal could happen some time in November or December.  Both bulk and block deals are done on stock exchanges. A block deal happens when a transaction involves a minimum quantity of 5,00,000 shares or a minimum value of Rs 5 crore between two parties. Such deal takes place through a separate window at the beginning of trading hours for the duration of 35 minutes i.e. from 9.15 am to 9.50 am in a price range of +1% to -1% (plus or minus 1 per cent) of the ruling market price.  A bulk deal is a trade where total quantity of shares bought or sold is more than 0.5 per cent of the number of shares of a listed company. Bulk deals happen during the normal trading window provided by the broker.  The official said the government's 51.92 crore shares could be sold to ONGC using either the bulk or block deal.  This would also help avoid triggering an open offer.  The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had on July 19 granted 'in-principle' approval to the strategic sale of the government's existing 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL to ONGC &amp;quot;along with the transfer of management control, which will result in HPCL becoming a subsidiary company of ONGC&amp;quot;.  But since the offer meant a transfer of management control from the government to ONGC, there was apprehension it would trigger Sebi's takeover code and compel ONGC to make an open offer to acquire an additional 26 per cent stake from minority shareholders, he said.  So, the terms of sale have been amended to state that &amp;quot;HPCL will continue to be a government company in terms of section 2(45) of the Companies Act, 2013 and will continue to be controlled by the Government of India through ONGC under the administrative control of the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas&amp;quot;.  Though the government is cashing out on its holding, the amended terms make it clear that it will continue to retain control of HPCL, the official said, adding that since there is no transfer of actual control, there will be no requirement of an open offer.  At today's trading price of Rs 428.75, ONGC would have to pay Rs 33,268 crore for buying the government's 51.11 per cent stake. Had it been required to make an open offer, it would have had to shell out additional Rs 17,100 crore to buy another 26 per cent from the open market.  Another official said ONGC will have to borrow about Rs 25,000 crore to fund just the purchase of the government stake.  Half of the company's Rs 15,000 crore of cash has already gone into buying Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation's stake in a KG basin gas block, and after accounting for capital expenditure requirement for the current year, ONGC will be left with Rs 4,000-5,000 crore.  The rest will have to be borrowed, he said.  HPCL has 24.8 million tonnes per annum of refining capacity.

2017-09-05T08:11:22+05:30,ONGC,Faizan Javed,India to bid for Israel oil-and-gas exploration blocks: Dharmendra Pradhan,India and Israel have deep defence ties but Modi and his right wing ruling group are pushing to expand the relationship into other sectors such as energy and technology with a country they see as a natural ally against terrorism.,"Indian state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp plans to bid for Israeli offshore oil-and-gas exploration blocks, India&rsquo;s oil minister told Reuters, the first major deal between the two countries since a groundbreaking trip by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in July.  India and Israel have deep defence ties but Modi and his right wing ruling group are pushing to expand the relationship into other sectors such as energy and technology with a country they see as a natural ally against terrorism.  A high-ranking delegation from India, the world&rsquo;s third-biggest oil consumer, visited Israel last month to discuss taking part in the tender for blocks in the Mediterranean Sea and Israeli officials said they were pleased with the visit.  &ldquo;We will definitely bid for Israel&rsquo;s oil-and-gas blocks,&rdquo; Indian Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told Reuters.  There was no immediate comment from Israel&rsquo;s energy ministry.  When Modi visited Israel in July, both sides showed interest to build a broader economic relationship, rather than one based on defence, which had drawn them together because of similar concerns about militant threats they face. They are starting from a relatively low economic base as bilateral trade was just $2 billion in 2016.  Many oil majors have been hesitant to enter the Israeli market, fearing a backlash from oil-rich Arab states hostile to the country.  Israel put 24 exploration blocks up for auction in November 2016 and the country&rsquo;s energy minister, Yuval Steinitz, has said he would be happy to choose two or three foreign explorations groups. The auction closes on November 15.  India is conducting a technical and commercial analysis to participate in the Israel&rsquo;s bidding process, said Sanjay Sudhir, a joint secretary in the federal oil ministry, who led the delegation.  &ldquo;We dove into all the relevant details of the tender - geological, technical - and familiarised them with Israel&rsquo;s oil and gas ecosystem,&rdquo; an official at Israel&rsquo;s Energy Ministry said on the Indian team&rsquo;s visit, declining to be identified in the absence of permission to speak to the media.  Israel wants to open up its hydrocarbon sector, which is currently dominated by a partnership of Noble Energy and Delek Group. They control the Tamar and the much larger Leviathan fields.  India also wants to participate in the upcoming auction to explore and develop gas fields off the coast of Lebanon, Pradhan said in July. Three of those blocks border waters with Israel, with which Lebanon has a long-standing maritime border dispute.  ONGC is India&rsquo;s biggest energy exploration firm and a source at its overseas investment arm ONGC Videsh said the firm would not bid for any block in areas disputed by Israel and Lebanon.  &ldquo;Israel has said that none of the blocks it has offered are in disputed waters,&rdquo; said the source.  Another state-run explorer, Oil India Ltd, has not yet decided to bid in Israel&rsquo;s licensing round, the Indian company&rsquo;s chairman, Utpal Bora, told Reuters.  India&rsquo;s decision to bid for blocks off Israel and Lebanon comes after a setback in getting development rights for a giant gas field in Iran.  Indian companies discovered the Farzad B gas field in Iran in 2008 and have bid several times for the development rights, but media reports suggest that Tehran has decided to award the field to Russia&rsquo;s Gazprom.","Business, Companies, gas, Israel, Narendra Modi, oil, ONGC","ONGC,business,companies,Israel,oil,Gas,Narendra Modi",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/india-to-bid-for-israel-oil-and-gas-exploration-blocks-dharmendra-pradhan_9616321.html

India's largest oil and gas producer has about Rs 13,000 crore in cash and would need to borrow the rest to fund the buying of government's 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL.  ONGC has sought shareholder approval for &amp;quot;borrowing/ raising funds in Indian rupee and/ or foreign currency by issue of debt instruments (including bonds, non-convertible debentures and notes) in domestic and/ or overseas market&amp;quot; of Rs 25,000 crore.  The borrowings would be for &amp;quot;acquisition of projects/ equity shares and/or going concerns, meeting capital expenditure, working capital requirements and general corporate purposes during the period commencing from the date of passing of Special Resolution till completion of twelve months thereof or the date of the next annual general meeting in the financial year 2018-19, whichever is earlier,&amp;quot; the company said in a shareholder resolution.  The resolution would come up for voting at the company's annual general meeting (AGM) of shareholders on September 27.  The board of ONGC last month gave 'in principle approval' for the acquisition of the government stake in HPCL, which at today trading price of Rs 477.65 is worth about Rs 37,000 crore.  ONGC holds 13.77 per cent stake in IOC, which at today's trading price is worth Rs 28,800 crore. It also holds 4.83 per cent stake in gas utility GAIL India Ltd, which is worth Rs 1,550 crore.  But the company is not likely to sell any of it to fund the HPCL buy, officials said.  A six-member Committee of Directors has been constituted to examine various aspects of the acquisition and to provide its recommendations to the board.  The panel includes Chairman and Managing Director Dinesh K Sarraf and Director (Finance) A K Srinivasan as also independent directors K M Padmanabhan, Sumit Bose and Vivek Mallya.  Director (Technology &amp;amp;amp; Field Services) Shashi Shanker, who has been selected to succeed Sarraf as the chairman of ONGC at the end of September, will also be part of the panel.  The official said the acquisition will be done as per the Sebi takeover code. The price most likely will be 6-month average of HPCL scrip on the day of the decision.  The government last month had approved sale of its 51.11 per cent stake in oil refiner HPCL to India's largest oil producer ONGC.  Prior to the merger, HPCL is likely to take over Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) to bring all the refining assets of ONGC under one unit. ONGC currently owns 71.63 per cent of MRPL while HPCL has 16.96 per cent stake in it.  The official said ONGC will not have to make an open offer to minority shareholders of HPCL as the government's holding is being transferred to another state-run firm and the ownership is not changing.  The deal will be completed within a year, he said. HPCL will become a subsidiary of ONGC and will remain a listed company post the acquisition, the source said, adding that the board of the refining and marketing company will continue to remain separate.  The government has also constituted a committee -- headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and comprising oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan and road minister Nitin Gadkari to work out the modalities of the sale.  Jaitley had, in his Budget for 2017-18, talked about creating an integrated oil behemoth. After that oil companies were asked to give their options.  ONGC had evaluated options of acquiring either HPCL or BPCL -- the two downstream oil refining and fuel marketing companies.  It found the nation's second-biggest fuel retailer BPCL too expensive and conveyed its choice to the parent oil ministry.  Sources said the transaction is likely to be completed within the current financial year, ending March 31, 2018.  HPCL will add 23.8 million tonnes of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC's portfolio, making it the third-largest refiner in the country after IOC and Reliance Industries.","BPCL, Business, Companies, debt, HPCL, IOC, MRPL, ONGC, Reliance Industries","ONGC,HPCL,business,companies,debt,IOC,Reliance Industries,BPCL,MRPL",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-to-borrow-rs-25000-cr-to-fund-hpcl-buy_9611381.html
2017-09-04T14:09:46+05:30,ONGC,Sonal Jadhav,Expect financial performance of FY18 to be better than previous year: ONGC,"In an interview to CNBC-TV18, AK Srinivasan, Director-Finance at Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) shared his FY18 outlook.","In an interview to CNBC-TV18, AK Srinivasan, Director-Finance at Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) shared his FY18 outlook.  We are seeing stable production in the crude oil space and gas. We are going to do better from the previous year, he said.  This will increase company&rsquo;s revenue space, also gas prices will be higher from October 1 than current prices, he added.  For every dollar increase in gas price, revenue gets impacted by Rs 4,000 crore and for every dollar increase in crude oil, revenue gets impacted by Rs 900 crore, said Srinivasan.  On Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) issue he said, HPCL will be a separate listed entity, will not merge with ONGC.  Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview:  Anuj: What is happening in your space right now? Are you going through a bit of a goldilocks scenario? You do not have to compensate for under recoveries and at the same time oil is also inching up a bit. Are realisations now looking better than ever?  A: Definitely and also from the perspective of our growth we are seeing stable production in the crude oil space and gas. We are going to do better from the previous years. This will increase our revenue space and also gas prices will be higher from October 1 than current prices. So definitely revenues are going to be slightly better than what it was last year.  Latha: You would have done your own math; after all you know the formula. Where is the gas price likely to settle for the next six months when it is announced at the end of the month and what will it do to your margins, any ballpark arithmetic?  A: Roughly gas prices should be in and around USD 3 and for every dollar impact on our total year revenue is about Rs 4,000 crore. So if you look for half year, Rs 1,000 crore should be in and around on my volumes.  Reema: Crude prices have inched up a tad bit. What would all this mean for the net realisations of the company in the quarter that we are currently in?  A: For every dollar increase in crude oil, my topline goes up by around Rs 900 crore. If you look at it on quarter basis, it should be half the volumes and for 1/4th of the volume it should be about Rs 250 crore going up for every dollar.  Reema: USD 51 per bbl was the net realisation in Q1. Considering we are 2/3rd of the quarter through, what is your expectation of what the net realisations could be in Q2?  A: If it is more than the previous price averages and even if it is going up by USD 2, as I said for every dollar increase it gives me about Rs 250 crore, so to that extent my revenues increase across.  Latha: We heard from the ONGC top management, source based, that you all are not going to merger HPCL into your company and therefore the question of an open offer doesn't arise. Is that the final word, anything that you can update us on the HPCL issue?  A: In principle the company has taken the approval process through board that we will be acquiring 51 percent share and definitely it will be kept as a separate company. It is not going to merge with ONGC. It will be a standalone company.  Latha: How will you fund USD 5 billion acquisition?  A: There are various options and we are examining all the pros and cons of the transaction and based on the appropriate situation and what is cost benefit to the company, those will be taken up as a process.  Latha: Any sale of your shares in Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) or Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited (MRPL) is on the table?  A: Not as on date. However, as we go along we will have to evaluate all the multiple options which are in front of the company and as the due diligence process is continued and carried out, based on which an appropriate decision will be taken.  Latha: If it is either or - IOC or MRPL, what would you prefer to sell?  A: It is too premature from my point to view to make a comment because it is a decision of a board, a committee which need to take a view about it.  Reema: What is your guidance on gas production for FY18 or this fiscal year?  A: If you look at crude oil, it is going to be about 25.93 in the current year in total and for gas it should be 25.34.  Latha: These other companies that are on the block because of their default status. One of them is Videocon and it has some oil assets. They should be available at distressed valuation to you. Is ONGC an interested buyer?  A: Basically a buyer and a seller have to settle down with the prices and the evaluations are, if any opportunity is there, they will be commercially evaluated. If the deal looks attractive, the company may make a decision but a process of diligence or if a block is available, we will definitely look and evaluate it. Right now we will not be making decision whether we are buying or not buying.  Latha: But you will look or have looked?  A: No, we have not looked at anything.","Business, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC)","AK Srinivasan, Director-Finance at ONGC,crude oil space,gas,Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL)",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/expect-financial-performancefy18-to-be-better-than-previous-year-ongc_9609401.html

In a statement issued on Independence Day celebrations at the company's headquarters in Dehradun, ONGC said despite tumbling oil prices in the last three years, it not only sustained production from existing fields through incremental inputs but has also taken large meaningful and calculated investment decisions to ensure sustained volumes and financial growth.  Government is targeting increase in share of gas in the energy basket from 6.5 per cent to 15 per cent in the next few years.  ONGC said 17 projects with a combined capex of Rs 76,000 crore have been approved in the last three years.  &amp;quot;These projects would produce 69 million tonnes of crude oil and 118 billion cubic meters of natural gas during their profile period. Cumulative production from these projects would peak during 2020-21 at 6.65 million tonnes of crude and 13.38 BCM of gas which is 45 per cent of company's oil and gas standalone production during FY17,&amp;quot; it said.  Its flagship project includes Cluster-II in Bay of Bengal block KG-DWN-98/2 (KG-D5). The project would produce about 25 million tonnes of oil and 50 BCM of gas over the life of the project with peak production of 4 million tonnes of oil and 5.5 BCM of gas.  This would be equivalent to 17 per cent and 24 per cent of ONGC's current standalone oil and gas production, respectively.  During the last three years, ONGC completed 15 production related projects (including 8 brownfield and 7 greenfield) with capital investment of Rs 54,000 crore.  &amp;quot;These would produce 87 million tonnes of crude and 56 BCM of gas during their profile period,&amp;quot; the statement said, adding during FY17, ONGC produced 5 million tonnes of crude and 3.5 BCM of gas from these projects, which is 22 per cent and 16 per cent of its standalone crude and gas production, respectively.  Stating that it made 23 hydrocarbon finds with a total reserve accretion of 65 million tonnes of oil equivalent in 2016-17, ONGC said its onshore assets have reversed declining trend in production, persisting for several years, by registering crude production at 5.97 million tonnes in FY17 as against 5.82 million tonnes in FY16.","Business, gas, ONGC","ONGC,business,gas",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-eyes-doubling-gas-production5-6-years_9483181.html

ONGC, which has opened for commercial production six out of India's seven producing basins, has made a significant natural gas discovery in the Gulf of Kutch of Gujarat coast that can produce about three million standard cubic meters per day, a senior company official said.  This will open up the country's eighth sedimentary basin - the first in over three decades - for oil and gas production in two years.  &amp;quot;We can bring to production the find in 2-3 years time,&amp;quot; he said.  ONGC reviewed the project with Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan last week and set out conditions that will help monetise the gas reserves.  &amp;quot;The present government-mandated gas price of USD 2.48 per million British thermal unit does not make the discovery commercially viable. Since the find is in shallow waters, it does not qualify to get the USD 5.56 per mmBtu cap price set for difficult fields,&amp;quot; the official said.  The current rates of gas are uneconomic, he added.  &amp;quot;We have asked the government to give us pricing and marketing freedom. What sense does it make to use precious foreign exchange to pay USD 6-7 for importing gas and not pay an equivalent amount to domestic producers. Afterall, any domestic production would only aid government's Make-in-India initiative,&amp;quot; he said.  India has 26 sedimentary basins, of which only seven have commercial production of oil and gas. Except for the Assam shelf, ONGC opened up for commercial production all the other six basins, including Cambay, Mumbai Offshore, Rajasthan, Krishna Godavari, Cauvery and Assam-Arakan Fold Belt.  The official said the discovery made in the Gulf of Kutch is in shallow waters, but cannot be tied to either the production facilities in Mumbai High fields or Hazira and may require a new landfall point.  The BJP-led government had in October 2014 evolved a new pricing formula using rates prevalent in gas surplus nations like the US, Canada and Russia to determine rates in a net importing country.  Prices have halved to USD 2.48 per mmBtu since the formula was implemented.  India's largest natural gas producer is demanding a floor or minimum price of natural gas be fixed at USD 4.2 per mmBtu and rates freed in a years time.  &amp;quot;We hope the government listens to us,&amp;quot; the official said. &amp;quot;We should be able to bring the new find to production within 2-3 years from the date they give us for the requisite approvals,&amp;quot; he said.","Business, gas, Oil and Natural Gas Corp, ONGC","Oil and Natural Gas Corp,ONGC,business,Gas",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-seeks-market-freedom-to-open-india39s-8th-sedimentary-basin_9358241.html

The revenue came in lower by 12.2 percent at Rs 19,073 crore against previous quarter&rsquo;s Rs 21,714 crore.  Most broking house kept buy rating on the stock, as they expects the gas production will increase going ahead and domestic gas prices will move up from 2HFY18.  Brokerage: Motilal Oswal| Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 195  The company's June quarter numbers were below expectation. The revenues came in below the due to lower sales/production ratio. The PAT was impacted due to higher interest cost, lower other income and higher tax rate.  Meanwhile, oil sales grew 2.4 percent YoY and gas sales grew 15 percent. Also, oil production grew by 2 percent YoY and gas production increased by 9.2 percent YoY.  The firm expects the gas production to increase again, led by completion of its development projects. They expect gas production to increase 10-15 percent annually, going ahead.  Brokerage: CIMB | Rating: Add | Target: Rs 215  According to CIMB the company's standalone 1QFY18 net profit was at Rs 3880 crore which is 15 percent below estimate due to lower crude revenue.  Meanwhile, the gas production in particular is showing momentum due to additional production from new fields like Daman and Vasistha.  It expects the domestic gas prices will move up from 2HFY18 in line with the pricing formula and believe there is a fair chance that the government raises the pricing formula over the next 12-18 months to incentivise domestic production.  CIMB said that the HPCL transaction is an overhang for now and crude oil remains a key stock driver.  Brokerage: JPMorgan | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 185  JPMorgan said that gas productions growth picked up and should continue. The gas production has been increasing for four quarters and company expects&nbsp;FY18 gas production at 25.43BCM and this would imply a y/y increase of 9 percent.  As the valuations are looking attractive, there is a case for a trade in the stock from the current levels, but it is weak for an investment point of view.  Brokerage: BoAML | Rating: Buy | Target: Rs 179  BoAML expects the strong 1Q production growth trends are likely to sustain with ONGC reiterating a robust guidance. The gas price are expected to rise by 15 percent in September.  The completion of project and acquisitions are likely to reverse the trend of falling production. Meanwhile the medium term profile also looks robust with likely startup of KG D5 project and potential surprises from GSPL&rsquo;s DeenDayal field.  Brokerage: CLSA | Rating: Buy  CLSA expects all key parameters of the company to improve. Further, it sees domestic gas price to rise by 17 percent in October 2017 along with a slow recovery in crude prices. The stock is pricing Brent at USD 47 per barrel and said that the company is one of the cheapest large cap E&amp;amp;amp;Ps in the world.","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Stocks Views","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,ONGC",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/stocks-views/hereâsbrokeragessaying-about-ongc-as-q1-misses-estimates_9349261.html

2017-07-26T09:07:23+05:30,ONGC,Faizan Javed,"'IOC, GAIL stake sale to buy HPCL won't change ONGC metrics'",The rating agency said that the Indian government's approval to sell its majority 51.11 per cent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) to Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd (ONGC) is likely to be credit neutral for the state explorer.,"ONGC's financial ratios will remain largely unchanged if it funds the Rs 28,000 crore acquisition of HPCL through sale of its minority stake in IOC and GAIL, S&amp;amp;amp;P Global Ratings said.  The rating agency said that the Indian government's approval to sell its majority 51.11 per cent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) to Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd (ONGC) is likely to be credit neutral for the state explorer.  It however did not see much benefit in combining of HPCL's downstream oil refining and fuel marketing business with ONGC's oil and gas production.  &amp;quot;We do not expect any significant synergy between ONGC's upstream operations and HPCL's downstream operations although it will provide some diversity. Also, a complete merger of ONGC and HPCL is unlikely because we believe that will have significant challenges in integrating the people, systems, and corporate culture,&amp;quot; it said in a statement.  ONGC has a 71.63 per cent stake in Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, which has a capacity of 15 million tonnes per year. Combining this with HPCL's similar refining capacity and about 15,000 fuel retail stations could help derive some procurement benefits.  S&amp;amp;amp;P said if ONGC exercises the option of divesting its minority stakes in other state-run oil and gas companies to fund the acquisition of the HPCL stake, ONGC's financial metrics will be largely unchanged. However, using debt to fund the HPCL stake will put pressure on ONGC's stand-alone credit profile.  S&amp;amp;amp;P said the deal could take six months to complete and ONGC would be able to secure the necessary approval from the government and regulatory bodies to avoid triggering a mandatory open offer to buy an additional 26 per cent stake in HPCL from the public.  ONGC's financial ratios, it said, will remain largely unchanged if it funds the HPCL stake purchase by selling its stakes in IOC and GAIL.  &amp;quot;We expect ONGC's ratio of funds from operations (FFO) to debt to remain at 35-40 per cent over the next two to three years post the proposed transaction,&amp;quot; it said.  ONGC has 13.77 per cent stake in IOC, valued at Rs 25,400 crore and 4.87 per cent stake in GAIL (India) Ltd, valued at Rs 3,100 crore.  &amp;quot;We believe ONGC -- with the required approvals -- can sell these stakes in the open market to fund the HPCL deal. However, the divestment may be gradual and ONGC could meanwhile fund the HPCL stake purchase using a bridge loan,&amp;quot; it said.  The rating agency said if ONGC funds the deal with debt of about USD 4.5 billion, the company's FFO-to-debt ratio to trend towards 30 per cent -- below the trigger for a lower assessment of rating -- potentially resulting in at least a one notch lower.  In addition, if ONGC makes an open offer for the additional 26 per cent stake, the company will need to pay out a further Rs 14,500 crore, potentially resulting in a lower rating assessment by two notches.  The deal is a part of the government's announcement to create an integrated national oil major by combining several of its state-owned oil and gas companies.  &amp;quot;However, we believe the government's intention may be to have a few large integrated oil companies instead of one big integrated national oil major. Still, such combined entities will be small in comparison to global oil majors,&amp;quot; it said.  Combining HPCL will improve ONGC's cash flow stability and operating scale to an extent. However, there will be no material change in ONGC's business risk profile.  This is because HPCL's pre-tax profit is relatively modest -- about 25 per cent of ONGC's. HPCL will remain a majority-owned subsidiary of ONGC.","Business, HPCL, IOC, ONGC, S&P Global Ratings","ONGC,business,HPCL,IOC,S&amp;amp;P Global Ratings",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/39ioc-gail-stake-sale-to-buy-hpcl-won39t-change-ongc-metrics39_9331201.html

Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) will remain a public sector unit with a separate board and brand identity post Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) acquiring government's entire 51.11 per cent stake, which at current prices is valued at about Rs 28,800 crore.  Post-merger all refining units of ONGC will be accumulated under HPCL, making it India's third largest oil refiner after Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Reliance Industries, Pradhan said.  Making a suo motu statement in the Lok Sabha, he said the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) had on July 19 given 'in-principle' approval for strategic sale of the government's existing 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL to ONGC along with the transfer of management control.  &amp;quot;For overseeing this transaction, CCEA approved setting up of an alternative mechanism, headed by Finance Minister, which will help in taking quick decision with regard to the timing, price, terms and conditions and other related issues,&amp;quot; he said.  Pradhan and Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari will be part of the ministerial panel.  Stating that the merger will be completed within the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2018, Pradhan said valuations and other modalities of the state will be strictly driven by the market regulator SEBI rules.  Valuation and transaction advisers will be appointed soon, he said.  &amp;quot;The proposed acquisition in the oil sector, will create a vertically integrated public sector oil major having presence across the entire value chain. This will give ONGC an enhanced capacity to bear higher risks, take higher investment decisions and to neutralise the impact of global crude oil price volatility,&amp;quot; he said.  The acquisition of HPCL by ONGC will result in significant synergies in terms of optimisation of logistics costs, R&amp;amp;amp;D activities, economies of scale of purchase of crude oil and optimisation in refinery operations.  After the acquisition by ONGC, HPCL will continue to be a central government public sector enterprise. &amp;quot;It can still maintain its cultural uniqueness and brand identity, distinct from ONGC,&amp;quot; Pradhan said.  Talking to reporters outside Parliament House, he said the modalities of bringing refining units of MRPL and HPCL under one umbrella would be decided by their respective boards.  &amp;quot;HPCL currently has 24.8 million tonnes per annum of refining capacity. Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) - a subsidiary of ONGC, has 15.1 million tonnes. After this deal, the entire refining capacity of ONGC Group will come under HPCL.  &amp;quot;So, HPCL will have 40 million tonnes of refining capacity and will be third largest in the country after IOC which has 69.2 million tonnes capacity and Reliance Industries which has 62 million tonnes,&amp;quot; he said.  Pradhan said MRPL will merge with HPCL but did not indicate timelines. &amp;quot;HPCL already has 16.96 per cent in MRPL. So there already is synergy there,&amp;quot; he said.  ONGC owns 71.63 per cent of MRPL, a company it had acquired from AV Birla Group in March 2013.  HPCL plans to set up a 9 million tonne unit in Rajasthan as well as expand its Vishakhapatnam refinery in Andhra Pradesh. This will take the company to 50 million tonnes-plus category, he said.  For ONGC, the deal will bring to it assurance of market as well as greater capability to bid for not just oil and gas fields but also refinery and downstream projects abroad, he said.  &amp;quot;Previously, the issue was about supply security but the world over market security is being sought,&amp;quot; he said, adding that HPCL controls one-fourth of fuel retailing market in India.  HPCL as a brand with a separate board and its own identity will continue, he said.","Arun Jaitley, Business, Dharmendra Pradhan, Economy, Finance Minister","Finance Minister,Arun jaitley,economy,business",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/arun-jaitley-to-head-panelhpcl-stake-sale-to-ongc_9317841.html
2017-07-23T12:55:18+05:30,ONGC,PTI,ONGC not to make open offer post HPCL acquisition: Official,ONGC will not have to make an open offer to minority shareholders of HPCL as the government's holding is being transferred to another state-run firm and the ownership isn't really changing.,"ONGC will not be required to make an open offer to minority shareholders of HPCL after buying out government's 51.11 per cent stake as the deal won't trigger takeover norms as did the IOC-IBP merger in 2002, a senior government official said.  The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) last week gave in-principal approval of Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) buying out government's entire 51.11 per cent stake in fuel retailing and marketing company Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd. HPCL will continue to be a separate listed company.  ONGC will not have to make an open offer to minority shareholders of HPCL as the government's holding is being transferred to another state-run firm and the ownership isn't really changing.  &amp;quot;Open offer is not required because the management complexion is not changing. So it is a related party transaction,&amp;quot; the officer said.  As per Sebi's takeover code, if a company acquires more than 25 per cent in another listed company, it has to make an open offer to minority shareholders to buy at least 26 percent more in the target firm.  Way back in February 2002, state-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) had acquired government's 33.58 per cent stake in fuel retailer IBP Co Ltd for Rs 1,153.68 crore and had to make an open offer for additional shares.  &amp;quot;IOC and IBP merger had happened through bidding route. Reliance Industries was among the bidders. That time, IBP was being offered for outright sale, so when management chose to sell through bidding, the open offer got triggered,&amp;quot; the official said, requesting anonymity.  In the present case, &amp;quot;in ONGC, I am transferring from direct government control to indirect holding,&amp;quot; he said.  Government is 51 percent owner of HPCL and 68 per cent owner of ONGC.  &amp;quot;So, if one of the companies keeps the shares of the other, it is a related party transaction. But that does not mean government has sold the company. Government will indirectly hold stake in the company.  &amp;quot;It is a related party transaction which should not trigger takeover code unless the valuations are absurd. If those conditions are satisfied, it will never happen. We have kept in mind interest of both ONGC and HPCL,&amp;quot; the official said.  The deal, which flows from Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's Budget announcement of creating an integrated oil company, will help ONGC spread its risks.  From being a mere oil and gas producer, it will also have downstream oil refining and fuel retailing business. &amp;quot;When upstream business is down, downstream does great and vice versa. So now ONGC will be able to better manage its risks,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Through this vertical integration, what private sector could not achieve, the government has achieved,&amp;quot; he added.  HPCL will add 23.8 million tonnes of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC's portfolio, making it the third-largest refiner in the country after IOC and Reliance Industries.  ONGC already is majority owner of MRPL, which has a 15- million tons refinery.

Both &mdash; ONGC and HPCL &mdash; are public sector enterprises. While ONGC is an upstream company, where oil is extracted and the impurities are removed, HPCL refines the oil after it is extracted, making sub-products of oil.  The deal is a step towards the government's plan&nbsp;to create an integrated oil giant, as proposed in Budget 2017.  However, the deal has its pros and cons. Here's a glimpse -  Why the Deal Makes Sense  &amp;amp;gt; The merger will be a huge step in the direction of achieving the government's&nbsp;divestment target which was set at Rs 72,500 crore for FY17 in the Union Budget.  &amp;amp;gt;&nbsp;HPCL will now be a subsidiary of ONGC giving it the wherewithal to keep a check on the operations of former.  &amp;amp;gt; The merger will create a bigger oil company that can compete with its global peers.&nbsp;However, the merged entity would still be smaller as compared to the top ten oil giants around the world.  &amp;amp;gt; The merger will help ONGC get more funds to attain more foreign products.&nbsp;The merged entity will stand to encourage research and development in the sector which can result in boost in production, refining and marketing of oil products.  &amp;amp;gt; Merger of two state-owned entities can help improve efficiency. The merged entity can find ways of cutting costs and increasing the output.  Why the Deal might Not Work  &amp;amp;gt; BPCL could have been a better pick for the merger. Motilal Oswal said in a report that &amp;quot;given the government's aim to boost the exploration and production strength of India, we see greater probability of ONGC merging with BPCL than with HPCL&amp;quot;.  &amp;amp;gt; There can be clashes due to difference in nature of operations. It could lead to interference from&nbsp;the parent (ONGC or the governemnt), the Economic Times reported quoting an Ambit Capital report.  &amp;amp;gt; The Ambit Capital report also said that the long-term holders should be concerned as ONGC doesn't have a good capital allocation record. HPCL may not gain from the deal at a time when subsidies have vanished and crude prices are low.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  &amp;amp;gt; It will still be very difficult for the merged entity to compete with global oil majors which already have a good market position.&nbsp;Out of the top ten global majors, seven are state-owned.  &amp;amp;gt; To enter the club of top state-owned oil majors, ONGC will have to infuse more funds, resulting in increase in costs which could eventually lead to higher prices of the oil products.","Business, crude, Economy, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL), India, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC)","ongc-hpcl merger,ongc,hpcl,divestment",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-hpcl39sdone-dealmakes-sensewhat-might-not-work_9299401.html

Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) had on December 7 last year signed Summary of Understanding (SoU) to give its Kalol field in Gujarat to Halliburton and Geleki field in Assam to Schlumberger to help in raising production above the current baseline output.  Though the agreements were signed in presence of Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan during the bi-annual Petrotech Conference, the ministry felt it was not proper to give away such contracts on nomination basis, sources privy to the development said.  The ministry in no uncertain terms told ONGC that such nomination contracts will not be acceptable, they said.  The ONGC board, which had approved the MoU, thereafter too took a similar and cancelled the SoUs, they said.  The company last week invited expression of interest (EoI) from service providers for undertaking production enhancement from its mature oil and gas fields.  The 15-year Production Enhancement Contract (PEC) will require the oilfield service producer to commit to invest in capital expenditure and operating expenditure to increase production form the existing 'baseline' output.  &amp;quot;The remuneration model will be a tariff which is to be paid in USD per barrel of oil and USD per million British thermal unit for gas for any 'incremental' hydrocarbon produced and saved over the baseline,&amp;quot; the EoI said. &amp;quot;Baseline shall be prepared by ONGC and vetted and certified by a third party of international repute.&amp;quot;  All the oil and gas produced will belong to ONGC and the service provider arrangement is being entered into to get the best technology available, sources said.  Under the terms of SoUs signed in December last year, Schlumberger and Halliburton were to invest capital and share technical expertise in the two stagnant but producing oilfields. If they are able to increase output, they were to be paid a pre-determined fee on each additional barrel of crude oil produced. Besides Schlumberger and Halliburton, ONGC was also in talks with Weatherford International and Baker Hughes Inc for similar arrangement for other fields.  But after the oil ministry disapproval, all such deals are off and all such contracts will be entered only when a service provider offers the highest increase in output in a competitive bidding, sources said.","Assam, Business, Gujarat, ONGC","ONGC,business,Gujarat,Assam",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-rescinds-pactsschlumberger-halliburton_9216521.html

Modi had in March 2015 called for cutting India's dependence on imports to meet its oil needs by 10 per cent by 2022 from 77 per cent then.  Import dependence has since only risen to 81 per cent.  &amp;quot;Most of our production of oil and gas come from nomination fields with ONGC and Oil India. We have now started monitoring those fields and have given new benchmarks to the national oil companies to increase production,&amp;quot; Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said at an industry event.   Explainer: How Daily Revision Of Petrol, Diesel Prices Works   He said oil recovery from reservoirs internationally is 35 to 40 per cent and that for gas is 55 to 70 per cent.  &amp;quot;In India, the current recovery factors of ONGC and Oil India for crude oil are as low as 27 per cent and 23 per cent. In case of natural gas, it is 54 per cent and 43 per cent for ONGC and Oil India, respectively,&amp;quot; he said.  Pradhan said there is a need for introducing new thinking, new technologies and remaining ahead of the curve.  &amp;quot;I am told E&amp;amp;amp;P sector should have major investment in 'Internet of Things'. Digital oil fields, all infrastructure linked to the network, ability to monetise micro reserves are the new areas we need to look at,&amp;quot; he said.  He cited the example of a marginal oil field in Vienna where sensors and small in-house innovations were used to reduce cost of production and monetise small gas production.  &amp;quot;In contrast, in India we have practices like having idle rigs and other assets; unscientific inventory and HR management; flaring of gas and remaining which are keeping us behind the technology curve,&amp;quot; he said.  The minister invited investors to come and invest in oil and gas exploration and production under liberal fiscal policies like pricing and marketing freedom and minimal government interference in management of contracts.  &amp;quot;The government has consciously tried to reduce administrative and regulatory roadblocks and to infuse new technologies,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Going forward, the government remains committed for making sustained and significant efforts to liberalise the sector by simplifying processes, increasing market access and bringing developments in the technology domain with the aim to enhance the efficiency of our oil and gas industry.&amp;quot;  He went on to state that there has never been a better time to invest in India's E&amp;amp;amp;P given the ample opportunities available.","Business, Dharmendra Pradhan, Narendra Modi, Oil India, ONGC, Prime Minister","Narendra Modi,prime Minister,ONGC,business,Oil India,Dharmendra Pradhan",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/govt-looks-to-improve-outputdomestic-oilgas-fields_9179681.html

2017-06-27T15:58:17+05:30,ONGC,PTI,Natural gas may be included in GST regime,"This essentially means that various goods and services procured by the oil and gas industry will be subject to GST, but the sale and supply of oil, gas and petroleum products will continue to attract earlier taxes like excise duty and VAT.","The GST Council may decide to include natural gas in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime as a measure to provide some relief to the oil and gas sector.  Currently, crude oil, petrol, diesel, jet fuel or aviation turbine fuel (ATF) and natural gas are not included in the new indirect tax structure, which is set to kick in from July 1.  This essentially means that various goods and services procured by the oil and gas industry will be subject to GST, but the sale and supply of oil, gas and petroleum products will continue to attract earlier taxes like excise duty and VAT.  Unlike other industries which can take credit for any tax paid towards furtherance of business, no credits on input GST will be available to the oil and gas industry leading to huge additional indirect tax burden with stranded costs of about Rs 25,000 crore.  &amp;quot;GST was based on the premise that no one will suffer any loss because of its rollout - neither the government nor the industry. But here is an industry which will see revenue loss from July 1,&amp;quot; a senior official said.  The oil ministry has taken up with the finance ministry for early inclusion of all the five exempted products in GST.  &amp;quot;There is a recognition even in the finance ministry that the current situation is not right. They are also making efforts to get the GST Council to see reason,&amp;quot; he said.  The GST Council, headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and comprising of representatives of all states, is the highest decision-making body on the new tax regime.  &amp;quot;There is an agreement that natural gas can be included in GST. Natural gas is largely an industrial product and so its inclusion will not be a problem,&amp;quot; he said.  The Council is scheduled to meet on June 30, hours before the new regime is rolled out. So far, inclusion of natural gas in GST has not been listed on agenda, but there is a concentrated push for doing so.  If natural gas is included, GST paid on inputs and services used for producing natural gas can be set off against taxes on its sale. This would cut the losses to the industry by one-fifth.  The move will benefit companies like Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) as well as gas retailers like Indraprastha Gas Limited (IGL).  &amp;quot;The oil ministry is urging the finance ministry to use its good offices to convince the GST Council on the issue,&amp;quot; the official said.  Keeping the five hydrocarbons out of GST would adversely affect both upstream companies like ONGC as well as downstream companies like Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation and Bharat Petroleum Corporation.  He said bringing crude oil, natural gas, petrol, diesel and ATF under GST at one go will be difficult and so a beginning can be made with natural gas.  Crude oil could be next. &amp;quot;Crude oil is also a totally industrial product that has no consumer interface and its inclusion in GST too should not be a problem,&amp;quot; he said.","Business, Economy, GST, India","Goods and Services Tax,GST,Finance Minister Arun Jaitley,FM Jaitley,crude oil in GST,natural gas,ONGC,BPCL,HPCL,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/natural-gas-may-be-includedgst-regime_9169701.html

The field, which had hit a peak of 29 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) in 2011, had seen output decline thereafter but the same has now been reversed in last three years.  Official sources said gas production has regained the 30 mmscmd mark and will climb to 34 mmscmd in few weeks before touching 37 mmscmd by December 2018.  The turnaround started after Sanjay Kumar Moitra, Executive Director, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), took over as the Asset Manager of Bassein and satellite fields in December 2013.  Crude oil production from the asset has risen from about 1 million tonnes to 2.5 million tonnes in last three years, making it the second highest oil producing asset of ONGC.  Sources said projects worth Rs 13,181 crore to exploit C-26, Daman, Bassein and Vasai East discoveries will help ramp up the output further.  Vasai East additional development project, costing Rs 2,476 crore, will help raise crude oil production from 5,600 barrels per day (bpd) to 17,550 bpd and gas from 1.3 mmscmd to 2.5 mmscmd.  The Rs 6,086 crore Daman development project will give a peak gas output of 8.3 mmscmd and 9,600 bpd of condensate while the Rs 4,619 crore Bassein integrated development project will help produce 19.36 bcm of gas and 1.97 million cubic meter of condensate.  C-26 Cluster development project, costing Rs 2,592 crore, would produce 5.94 bcm of gas and 0.644 million cubic meter of condensate, they said.  Located 80-km off the Mumbai coast, the Bassein gas field, also called the Vasai field, was discovered in 1976 and put in production in 1988. It achieved a peak output of 29 mmsmd in 2011 before starting to decline. The field, now in its 28th year, is well past its estimated life of 20 years.  Bassein field had 393 billion cubic meters of initial gas in place, of which 248 bcm (about 7 trillion cubic feet) has been produced.  It is ONGC's fastest growing asset, spread over 7,300 square kilometres in Arabian Sea. It comprises South Bassein field that produces 18 mmscmd of gas, NBP (D-1) field, B-193 super sour field, Vasai East field and C-Series and Daman gas field.","Business, Companies","natural gas,Bassein,Arabian Sea,Sanjay Kumar Moitra,Oil and Natural Gas Corp,ONGC",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc39s-bassein-gas-field-to-touch-record-output2018_9126021.html

2017-06-15T12:50:10+05:30,ONGC,Faizan Javed,India wants Iran to reciprocate on gas field award: Dharmendra Pradhan,Upset with the USD 5.5 billion master development plan submitted by ONGC Videsh Ltd - the overseas investment arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) - Iran has signed an initial pact with Russia's Gazprom for developing Farzad-B gas field.,"Having stood by Iran in its tough times, India expects Tehran to reciprocate by awarding rights of the coveted Farzad-B gas field to its discoverer, ONGC, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said.  Upset with the USD 5.5 billion master development plan submitted by ONGC Videsh Ltd - the overseas investment arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) - Iran has signed an initial pact with Russia's Gazprom for developing Farzad-B gas field.  &amp;quot;We value relationships. During difficult days of Iran, when the entire west imposed sanctions, we stood by them and bought substantial amount of crude oil. We also returned every penny when the banking channels reopened,&amp;quot; he said.  Now, Iran has to reciprocate. &amp;quot;We have that much expectation from Iran. I hope Iran will comply with that,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Our relationship with Iran is not based on a single commodity or a single transaction.&amp;quot;  With Tehran delaying the award of rights to develop the 12.5 trillion cubic feet gas field to its discoverer, OVL, India decided to cut oil imports from Iran by a fifth in 2017 -18.  Iran retaliated by first cutting by one-third the time it gave to Indian refiners to pay for oil they buy from it as also raising ship freight rates, and now by signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Russian gas monopoly Gazprom.  The MoU was signed between Gazprom and National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) in Kremlin on March 28 when Iranian President Hassan Rouhani met his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. The agreement spans Farzad-B, the North Pars and Kish fields.  Iran has been unhappy with the USD 5.5 billion investment plan of OVL as it will have to reimburse all of the money that is invested, together with a fixed rate of return. Tehran wants the investment to be lowered and OVL commit to buying gas at a price fixed by it.  OVL, on the other hand, says it will take up development only if the terms are economical and cannot absorb any cost and the price of gas should be comparable to rates in current market.  Sources said Indian refiners have cut oil imports from Iran by a fifth to 1,90,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2017-18 from 2,40,000 bpd in the previous fiscal.  Iran, India's third biggest oil supplier, used to give a 90-day credit period to refiners like Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) to pay for the oil they would buy from it.  Now, Tehran has reduced this to 60 days, essentially meaning that IOC and MRPL would have to pay for the oil they buy from Iran in 60 days instead of previous liberal term of 90 days, they said.  Iran oil sale terms were the most attractive for Indian refiners. Besides a liberal credit period, it also shipped the oil to India for a nominal 20 per cent of normal ocean freight.  Other Middle-East sellers offer not more than 15-day credit period.  Sources said NIOC has also decided to cut the discount it offers to Indian buyers on freight from 80 per cent to about 60 per cent.  Since the lifting of western sanctions, Iran has played hardball over award of the field which was discovered by OVL.  The two nations were initially targeting concluding a deal on Farzad-B field development by November 2016 but later mutually agreed to push the timeline to February 2017.  Now, the deal is being targeted to be wrapped up by September after the two sides agree on a price and a rate of return for OVL's investments.  Farzad B was discovered by OVL in the Farsi block about 10 years ago. The project has so far cost the OVL-led consortium, which also includes Oil India Ltd and Indian Oil Corp (IOC), over USD 80 million.  The field in the Farsi block has an in-place gas reserve of 21.7 tcf, of which 12.5 tcf are recoverable.  New Delhi is keen that the gas from the field comes to India to feed the vast energy needs.","Business, Dharmendra Pradhan, Iran, ONGC","Dharmendra Pradhan,ONGC,business,Iran",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/india-wants-iran-to-reciprocategas-field-award-dharmendra-pradhan_9104121.html

The company is also talking to at least five state governments including the Yogi Adityanath dispensation in Uttar Pradesh to form joint ventures to cater to the local needs for tourism and other purposes.  One of the officials said the company&rsquo;s gameplan included grabbing opportunities thrown up by the government&rsquo;s regional connectivity scheme.  Pawan Hans is a 51:49 joint venture between the government of India and state-owned explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd.  The official said the company was looking to operate small planes that have a seating capacity of 15-20 including ones that can land on sea. &ldquo;We are looking to operate 15-20 seater planes. We are also looking to fly sea planes with capacity of 6-10 seats and 18-20,&rdquo; he said. Another area that Pawan Hans is eyeing is skill development for flying helicopters.  Though not strictly comparable, helicopters are more expensive to operate with their cost of operations being at least four times more than the cost of flying a plane.  &ldquo;There is a huge shortage of pilots for flying helicopters. Most of the helicopter pilots are retired personnel from Indian Air Force. Some are trained at Hindustan Aeronautics&rsquo; Bengaluru centre while some others undergo training in Canada. But there is a genuine shortage of these pilots. We want to fill that gap,&rdquo; he said, adding the company had set up a centre at Rohini in Delhi to train aspirants to become helicopter pilots.  The company also wants to get into maintenance and repair as the popularity of helicopter services increases and hence the demand for their upkeep.  Pawan Hans is also exploring the possibility of forming joint ventures with state governments to facilitate tourist mobility to and from destinations like Char Dham and Buddha Circuit. One state government the company is talking to is Uttar Pradesh&rsquo;s Yogi Adityanath regime. According to the other official, the state was even willing to provide a top-up subsidy beyond the subsidy being given by the Centre under its regional connectivity scheme.  &ldquo;The UP government is willing to give under-writing on 30 percent of the seats beyond the mandated 50 percent,&rdquo; this official said.  Under the regional connectivity scheme, the government auctions selected unserved and under-served routes with the award going to the company that asks for the lowest viability gap funding. The winner gets a 3-year exclusive right to operate flights on the route. Fare for half the seats in a flight is capped at Rs 2,500 for an hour of a flight journey of approximately 500 km and a 30-minute helicopter journey.  The selected airline provides 50 percent of the flight capacity &ndash; with a minimum of 9 and maximum of 40 seats for planes and a minimum of 5 and maximum of 13 seats for helicopters -- under the regional connectivity scheme. The government plans to hold the second round of auctions in two months.  Pawan Hans is a disinvestment candidate with the government keen to its sell 51 percent stake in the company to a strategic buyer including ONGC if it is interested. Consulting firm Deloitte has been entrusted with the task of studying the company and preparing the documents to put it up for sale.","Business, Companies, ONGC, Pawan Hans, Yogi Adityanath","Pawan Hans,business,Yogi Adityanath,ONGC",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/pawan-hans-looks-beyond-helicopters-eyes-small-plane-services-jvyogi-govt_9087901.html
2017-06-07T19:16:27+05:30,ONGC,Rishma Kapur,Has government got its priority wrong in making ONGC buy its stake in HPCL?,"The 51.11 percent holding of government in HPCL is expected to fetch around Rs 28,000 crore for the government. The merger prima facie is a win-win for all the major stake holders.","Shishir Asthana Moneycontrol News  As against the expectation of a merger between the public sector companies&nbsp;ONGC and HPCL, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) has sought cabinet approval for Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) to buy out government&rsquo;s entire stake in the Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL).  Reacting to the news, ONGC was trading today 0.55 percent higher while HPCL traded 0.91 percent lower.  The 51.11 percent holding of government in HPCL is expected to fetch around Rs 28,000 crore for the government. The merger prima facie is a win-win for all the major stake holders.  The government cashes in on its holding of HPCL, while continuing to hold it indirectly through ONGC where it has a 68.07 percent stake. ONGC and HPCL both benefit on account of the merger through synergies and a stronger balance sheet.  In a report on the possible merger, Edelweiss pointed out that there are limited immediate cost synergies, but the combined entity will enjoy lower earnings volatility across oil price cycles. Globally integrated players have enjoyed higher returns and stable valuations across oil price cycles as compared to pure refiners or pure oil exploration and production companies.  ONGC has a strong balance sheet and can easily absorb HPCL. According to Edelweiss, the deal value is equivalent to 4 years of ONGC&rsquo;s free cash flow. And based on ONGC&rsquo;s stake in HPCL&rsquo;s operating cash flow, the reasonable payback period is five years.  Looking at these numbers, ONGC has got a very good deal as under no condition would it have been possible to have a 25 million tonne refinery of the size of HPCL with its 14,500 petrol pumps.  So, if everything seems so good why did&nbsp;share prices of ONGC and HPCL not react to this news?  The government in its budget had announced that they were keen on creating a large integrated oil company, in line with some of the global majors. But, since the news HPCL has not moved higher despite broader markets touching new highs. ONGC, on the other hand, has fallen since the budget.  The reason is in the details.  Oil exploration and refining is a higher Return on Equity (RoE) business as compared to refining. ONGC will thus be utilizing its cash and piling more debt in acquiring a company which delivers lower RoE.  What is critical for ONGC and the country is to acquire oil assets both in India and abroad. Apparently, the news of a possible buyout of government&rsquo;s stake in HPCL by ONGC came on the same day when Iran decided to give Russia the development rights of Farzad B gas fields, which was discovered by a consortium of Indian-run companies.  Iran, it seems was unhappy with the amount ONGC was willing to invest in the gas field. The move was also considered to counter India&rsquo;s decision to cut down oil imports from Iran. In such circumstances, it is more important for India and ONGC to secure and acquire its energy assets rather than meet government's divestment target through such forced acquisition.  Analysts have argued that the merged entity will be able to acquire stakes in bigger oil assets. But Indian companies, both in the private and public space, through various international acquisitions have shown that they are capable of acquiring assets by jointly bidding for the same. Merging the companies to create a bigger balance sheet does not hold water.  Another line of thought is why invest in an energy source when renewables are fast changing the world. Renewables installed capacity in India is 57 GW on a total power installed capacity of over 300 GW, but their feasibility - to a large extent - still dependent on government incentives. Stress is already visible across the value chain in the renewables space.  Further, oil apart from being used as a fuel also has multiple applications as a feedstock for petrochemical industry. Oil still has a long way to go before it can be completely substituted.  Thus, as far as ONGC&rsquo;s investment in HPCL is concerned, though the move seems good on account of synergistic benefits, the company would be spending resources in trying to integrate at a time when it should be acquiring oil assets, which is its main line of activity.  As oil prices are low and oil producing countries are in stress, this would have been a good time to acquire assets.","Business, Companies, Economy, HPCL, ONGC","ONGC,HPCL,DIPAM,ONGC HPCL merger",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/has-government-got-its-priority-wrongmaking-ongc-buy-its-stakehpcl_9073661.html

Being dubbed as 'super-boards', the committees will be headed by the ministry's upstream nodal authority DGH, and will review and monitor performance of areas given to Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) on nomination basis.  The two panels - one each for ONGC and OIL, will review from annual work programme and budget to declaration of a discovery as commercial as also reservoir and production performance, monitoring of development activities and collaborations with other explorers.  &amp;quot;The advice/decision of the Review Committee shall be implemented forthwith by the NOC (national oil company) concerned and the progress of implementation shall be reported to the Review Committee through DGH at its next meeting,&amp;quot; the May 25 order issued by Atanu Chakraborty, Director General, Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), said.  The order follows ministry's unhappiness with state explorers particularly on delays in projects linked to output enhancement. It has already ordered a detailed review of board of directors of ONGC for a possible revamp of the functional heads.  &amp;quot;They have all the powers to do so. We have to live with it,&amp;quot; said a senior official at one of the two explorers. &amp;quot;If they want to create a 'super-board' so be it,&amp;quot; he said.  The panels will be headed by DG, DGH and will have two other members from DGH - one Deputy DG and another head of Division in charge of NOCs-monitoring. One representative of ONGC or OIL not below the rank of director will be nominated by the NOCs.  Also, the manager of the asset that is under review would be co-opted as member of the committee, the order said.  ONGC produced 86 per cent of its 26.13 million tonnes of crude oil in 2016-17 fiscal from fields given to it on nomination basis. Natural gas production from nomination fields accounted for 93 per cent of the total output of 25.34 billion cubic meters.  In the order for 'Constitution of Review Committees for Management of Oil and Gas Resources of Nomination Fields of National Oil Companies (NOCs)', Chakraborty said the panels are being constituted drawing from powers given to DGH by the oil ministry orders.  The order for the constitution of the committees will &amp;quot;come into force with immediate effect,&amp;quot; he said.  The review committee will meet at least once every three months.  The powers of the panels include &amp;quot;annual work programmes and budgets in respect of exploration operations and any modification and revisions thereto&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;annual work programme and budgets in respect of development and production operations and any modifications and revisions thereto.&amp;quot;  It will also review &amp;quot;proposals for surrender or relinquishment of any part of the area included in the nomination field&amp;quot;.

It clearly shows that the company still has underutilized assets which can be unlocked further for better sales.  Recently in 2014, the company expanded its large-size pump capacity in Noida. These new additions are capable of generating revenues to the tune of Rs 300 crore at full capacity. This is almost three times its current revenues indicating that there is a lot more headroom for the utilisation to go up leading to significant impact on earnings.  Early signs are visible. In Q4 of FY17, its sales went up 31 percent to Rs 31.3 crore from the year-ago period but profit jumped by whopping 246 percent to Rs 3.33 crore. Since it&rsquo;s not a seasonal business and there is no one-time income, these numbers speak for a fairly good outlook.  Even at 70 percent of the quarterly profit, the company is likely to report annual profitability to the tune of Rs 9.3 crore on equity of Rs 50 crore. After adjusting for dividend (on an average the company paid out dividend of Rs 33-93 lakh over five years) its return on equity will move to an excess of 14 percent as against 7.85 percent in FY16.  Today, despite 25 percent operating margin, 10 percent net profit margins and debt-to-equity of 0.7 percent, return ratios are impacted due to low capacity utilizations. However, this could change once global and domestic industrial recovery gathers momentum.  Roto Pumps derives close to 65 percent of revenue from the exports market. It should benefit from any industrial upturn that seems to be showing nascent signs of recovery globally.  In India also, the company is looking at higher-order flows riding on government&rsquo;s initiatives like Make In India, Smart Cities Mission and reforms in the energy sector. Also, post implementation of the GST, private capex may revive in the organised small-scale sector as well.  Domestic opportunity &ndash; not yet harnessed  Roto has a wide range of products. Its PCP (Progressive Cavity pumps) range includes industrial pump, food pump, dosing pump, general-purpose pump and mining pump. The company's products serve various industries, which include sugar, agriculture and cattle, oil and gas, mining, chemicals, among others.  The size of the domestic motor pump market is about Rs 11,000 crore, which is largely dominated by players such as Kirloskar Brothers, KSB Pumps and Shakti Pumps. Kirloskar Brothers is the largest player having an annual sales turnover of Rs 1656 crore. The second largest player in this segment, KSB Pumps has turnover of Rs 827 crore followed by Shakti Pumps with an annual revenue of Rs 264 crore.  Roto with domestic sales of about Rs 33 crore is a much smaller player, but it is growing and has good clients. It has supplied its products to companies like Cairn India, ONGC, Reliance Industries, Indian Navy and Engineers India.  Consistent performer  Despite its small size, the company boasts of a track record of consistency. In the last 10 years it never had negative cash flows from its operations nor has it reported a loss in any of the years. During these years, it had grown equity at 18.50 percent annually without any dilution. It is noteworthy that in the last 15-16 years, it had not skipped dividend in any of the years.  Valuation &ndash; bang for the buck  Roto is a good play on India&rsquo;s capex cycle which is expected to achieve recovery a few quarters down the line. With extremely low debt of Rs 39 crore, the impact of operating leverage on profitability should be significant.  The current market capitalisation is Rs 126 crore on sales of Rs 94 crore, which is quite reasonable considering that there is enough headroom to scale the business. Historically, the company&rsquo;s assets turnover ratio has been in the range of 2.5 times as against the current levels of 1.1 times.  In Q4FY17, the company reported an EPS of Rs 2.16 per share, if we annualise and on a conservative basis assume that only 80 percent of the same will be achieved, price-to-earnings ratio at current market price of Rs 83 per share works out to a reasonable 12 times. This looks reasonable in the context of the quality of balance sheet and the growth prospects that lie ahead for this company.

Talking to reporters on the sidelines of an industry event, OVL Managing Director Narendra K Verma said OVL had in 2016-17 produced 12.57 MT crude oil and equivalent natural gas from its assets abroad.  OVL output was 8.92 MT oil and oil equivalent gas in the previous 2015-16 fiscal.  &amp;quot;In the current year we are targeting 14.37 million tons oil equivalent production,&amp;quot; he said.  OVL Director (Finance) Vivekanand said half of the current year's production would come from Russia's Vankor oilfield in which the company last year acquired 26 per cent stake.  OVL bought the stake in two tranches. First, it acquired 15 per cent in May 2016 for USD 1.268 billion, and then another 11 per cent in October 2016 for USD 930 million.  It received its 15 per cent share of oil from Vankor for the almost 11 months but 11 per cent share was only for a part of year as the deal.  This fiscal, it will get full 26 per cent share.  OVL's share of oil from Vankor will be 7.3 MT.  Vivekanand said the company has started getting dues from Venezuela, with almost USD 80 million being paid over the last 3-4 months.  Venezuela owed OVL around USD 530 million in unpaid dividends and has this year started to clear that in instalments.  &amp;quot;We got about USD 80 million but also had to invest USD 40 million back. So net we have got USD 40 million,&amp;quot; he said.  OVL had in April 2008 acquired 40 per cent stake in San Cristobal oil project in Venezuela. Corporacion Venezolana del Petr&oacute;leo (CVP), a unit of state-owned Petr&oacute;leos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), owns the remaining stake.  With an investment of USD 408.35 million, OVL's share of crude oil production from the 160.18 km acreage in the Orinoco Heavy Oil belt was 0.645 MT in 2014-15.  OVL received USD 56.224 million as dividend on profit made by CVP in 2008 but dividends from 2009 totalling to about USD 530 million remained unpaid due to cash flow difficulties being faced by PDVSA/CVP.  OVL has 37 projects in 17 countries. Of these, 14 assets in 10 countries are producing and four in a similar number of countries are under development.","Business, oil, ONGC, ONGC Videsh","ONGC Videsh,ONGC,oil,business",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ovl-sees-14-jumpoutput-this-fiscal_8906981.html

The output was up from 8.92 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas in the previous fiscal 2015-16, OVL Managing Director Narendra K Verma said.  In its over five-decade existence, which began in 1965 with a venture in Iran, OVL has seen a peak production of 9.45 million tonnes in 2010-11.  &amp;quot;Production in 2016-17 was higher on account of acquisition of stake in Russia's Vankor oil field,&amp;quot; Verma told PTI here.  For 2017-18, the company is targeting 14.37 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas production.  OVL last year bought 26 per cent stake in Vankor field in two tranches. First it acquired 15 per cent in May 2016 for USD 1.268 billion, and then another 11 per cent in October 2016 for USD 930 million.

OVL's share of oil from Vankor will be 7.3 million tonnes.  Besides OVL's 26 per cent, a consortium of comprising Oil India (OIL), Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Bharat PetroResources (BPRL) has acquired 23.9 per cent stake in the field at a cost of USD 2.02 billion, giving them 6.56 million tonnes of oil.  The daily production from the field is around 410,000 barrels per day of crude oil and 26% stake would give OVL about 107,000 bpd.  OVL has 37 projects in 17 countries. Of this, 14 assets in 10 countries are producing and four in a similar number of countries are under development, he said.  Verma said OVL's next incremental production will come from Columbia where it has made a significant discovery and from Iran where it is negotiating a contract for a gas field it had discovered.  OVL plans to spend USD 1 billion in the current fiscal to drill new wells and add production facilities in fields from Russia to Venezuela.  The company has 633 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas reserves in its assets abroad.  Acquisition of Vankor added 72.58 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas (15 per cent) and 51.96 million tonnes (11 per cent) of reserves to its portfolio.  Though the company had been in existence since 1965, its first production started only in 2002-03. In its first three decades, it did no major acquisition and its first breakthrough came in 1988 when it acquired stake in an oil and gas field in Vietnam. The next acquisition happened only 2001 when it bought 20 per cent stake in Sakhalin-1 project in Russia. There was no looking back thereafter.  It has so far invested USD 27.23 billion in overseas projects, the highest by any Indian company.","Business, ONGC, ONGC Videsh","ONGC Videsh,business,ONGC",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ovl-output-touches-record-1257-mn-tonnesfy17_8878561.html

AK Srinivasan, Director-Finance of the company analyses what the future may look like for the company.  Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview.  Sonia: I wanted to start by asking you about the gas output over the next few years because there are a lot of positive growth estimates coming in over there from the analyst fraternity. What will be your own assessment from the gas output over the next two years?  A: We are putting a new field onto production like WO16 and for Daman, one phase is already put in place and second phase also will come up by next year. Based on these, volumes of the gas will increase and going forward in 2022, we expect the gas volume to go up by around 3 percent to 23 percent from the existing level.  The existing new projects which are coming under implementation, due to which the gas volumes are going to go up in the current year by about 3 mmcmd. As you go forward, by 2022 our volumes are going to go up by about 23 percent from the existing levels.  Anuj: The other issue is the continuous decline that we are seeing in crude prices now? Has it reached a stage where it damages your overall net realisations and impacts the numbers as well?  A: Definitely the gas price at 2.48 that is there has an impact because my cost of production itself is 5.14 including my return. So definitely there is a shortfall in that.  Anuj: Any fresh development on the consolidation because we haven&rsquo;t heard much on that after that initial noise around the Budget?  A: There is nothing as of now.

2017-04-28T13:50:37+05:30,ONGC,Sunil Matkar,"Here's why Motilal Oswal has upgraded ONGC to buy, expects 31% growth in EPS","After two years of negative EPS growth, the research firm expects company's EPS growth at 31 percent in FY18 and 14 percent in FY19.","Moneycontrol News  Motilal Oswal has upgraded state-run ONGC to buy from neutral with a target price of Rs 233 (implying 30 percent upside), citing positive policy developments, cost efficiency and dividend yield of 4-6 percent. The stock rallied more than 2 percent intraday after this upgrade report.  After two years of negative EPS growth, the research firm expects company's EPS growth at 31 percent in FY18 and 14 percent in FY19.  Continued improved oil recovery (IOR) and contribution of new projects to production would also help reverse the decadal trend of negative-to-flat growth, it feels.  ONGC has spent a total of Rs 42,400 crore on improved oil recovery since 2000. In FY16, 29.6 percent of the oil production came from IOR.  The government has been working on incentivising recovery techniques, which may further reduce costs for the company, says the brokerage house.  Better optimisation has resulted in operating expenses coming down from USD 7.4/boe (barrel of oil equivalent) in FY16 to USD 5.9/boe in nine months period ended December 2016.  USD 1/boe change in operating expenses results in 7 percent change in EBITDA and EPS.  Motilal Oswal expects this cost efficiency to sustain going forward.  After meeting with management, the research firm believes gas production would grow at 10-15 percent annually for the next five years and its oil production has also been inching up.  ONGC expects Daman/C26 to add 4.5 mmscmd to production in FY18. S1 and Vashishta gas fields would add 1.5 mmscmd while WO16 would add 1.2 mmscmd in FY18.  Its IOR at the Bassein field is expected to add 3.9 mmscmd in FY19. In the longer run, Cluster-2 at KG DWN-98/2 would add a peak production of around 16 mmscmd.  ONGC has guided that oil production from nominated fields would increase. WO16 would add 3,800 bopd (barrels oil per day) in FY18 while Vasai East is likely to add another 4,800 bopd.  Its Ratna &amp;amp;amp; R-series would add 3,000 bopd in FY19 along with 8,000 bopd from B127 and 5,000 bopd from Assam. Ratna &amp;amp;amp; R-series would peak at 14,700 bopd in FY20 while production from Cluster-2 would commence in FY21, with peak expected at 77,000 bopd.  ONGC has not been bearing any subsidy since Q2FY16. Realisation in nine months period ended December 2016 was USD 48.65 barrel against USD 51.46 per barrel in nine months period ended December 2015.  Subsidy in nine months period ended December 2015 stood at USD 1.52 per barrel.  &amp;quot;We do not expect any subsidy burden to be levied on ONGC as long as oil prices are below USD 65 per barrel. However, realisation may be capped if oil prices rise above USD 65 per barrel,&amp;quot; says Motilal Oswal which estimated that USD 5 per barrel increase in realisation results in 10 percent increase in EPS.  The brokerage house&nbsp;says there are strong signs that OPEC would extend the ongoing production cut.  Hence, it expects oil prices to remain in the band of USD 50-60 per barrel, which would provide stability to its earnings.&nbsp;With Brent of USD 55/60 per barrel in FY18/19, it expects company's EPS of Rs 20/22.9 in FY18/19.

While the International Energy Agency (IEA) stated that global oil discoveries fell to a record low in 2016 as companies continued to cut spending and conventional oil projects sanctioned were at the lowest level in more than 70 years, ONGC stepped up its exploratory efforts to augment new production.  &amp;quot;FY 2016-17 has been one of the most successful years of the last decade in exploring oil and gas with more thrust in increased exploration activities during the year,&amp;quot; a top company official said.  Its exploratory efforts yielded 23 new discoveries, a 35 percent jump over 17 finds made in 2015-16 fiscal.  Of the 23 new discoveries, 12 are new prospects -- a potential trap which may contain hydrocarbons, while 11 are new pools -- a geological term for subsurface hydrocarbon accumulation.  As many as 13 new discoveries were made in on land and 10 in offshore wells.  &amp;quot;A total of 100 exploratory wells were drilled which is higher by 9 percent as compared to 92 wells drilled in the previous year 2015-16. Of these, 37 wells proved hydrocarbon bearing registering success ratio of 37 percent,&amp;quot; he said.  IEA in a report today said oil discoveries declined to 2.4 billion barrels in 2016, compared with an average of 9 billion barrels per year over the past 15 years.  Also, the number of projects that received a final investment decision dropped to the lowest level since the 1940s.  &amp;quot;This sharp slowdown in activity in the conventional oil sector was the result of reduced investment spending driven by low oil prices,&amp;quot; IEA said.  However, ONGC continued to spend more to help achieve Prime Minister Narendra Modi's target of reducing import dependence by 10 percent by 2022.  The official said the accretion of in place hydrocarbons was 203.24 million tons of oil and oil equivalent gas and the ultimate reserve accretion was 64.32 million tons.  Reserve Replacement Ratio (RRR) for the year has been 1.49.  The discoveries include two in Kutch and Saurashtra basin, off Gujarat coast.  Also, SRI-1 discovery in the NELP block KG-OSN-2009/2 in KG basin has established huge potential for syn-rift/deeper play in east coast shallow water.  Jabera-4 discovery established hydrocarbons for the first time in Vindhyan Basin and has given impetus for putting Vindhyan basin on hydrocarbon map of India, he said.  The official said ONGC is working on early monetisation of new discoveries. Nine on land discoveries made during the year have been monetised and put on production with average oil rate of 445 cubic meters per day and gas rate of 220,000 cubic meters a day.  The discoveries have cumulatively produced 38,809 tons of oil and 23.78 million standard cubic meters of gas during the year.","Business, ONGC","ONGC,oil reserves,discovery,International Energy Agency,Prime Minister Narendra Modi",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-makes-23-oilgas-discoveries_8841841.html

The central government will pay two state-owned firms' outstanding liabilities of Rs 14,698 crore directly to the state governments, who will not insist on levy of Rs 7,223 crore interest on payments that were due from April 2008. &amp;quot;This is a huge upside for us. The central government will pay to the states directly the royalty they were claiming from us. Thereupon the states would not insist upon interest payment,&amp;quot; ONGC Chairman and Manging Director Dinesh K Sarraf said. Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) had to pay Gujarat Rs 8,392 crore and Assam Rs 1,404 crore in royalties for the period between April 1, 2008 and January 2014. On this amount, it faced an interest liability of Rs 2,868 crore. Similarly, Oil India Ltd (OIL) had to pay the Assam government Rs 4,902 crore in royalty dues and another Rs 4,355 crore in interest. ONGC sold crude oil to PSU refiners at a discount since 2003-04 on government directive so as to help partly subsidise petrol, diesel, LPG and kerosene price. Royalty payable to the state, in which oil is produced, was paid on pre-discount sale price till March 31, 2008. Subsequently, royalty was paid to states on post discount sale price with effect from April 1, 2008 in line with an oil ministry order. Aggrieved by this, Gujarat filed a writ petition in Gujarat High Court which in November 2013 directed ONGC to make payment of royalty on pre-discounted price. ONGC challenged the decision in the Supreme Court which in February 2014 granted stay against the order of Gujarat High Court on the condition that the state-owned firm will pay royalty to Gujarat on pre-discounted price of crude oil with effect from February 1, 2014. In the meanwhile, the Government of Assam had also taken up the same matter in the Gauhati High Court. Sarraf said to settle the long pending issue an understanding has been reached wherein it has been agreed that the outstanding amount towards differential royalty would be paid by the Government of India directly to the Governments of Gujarat and Assam. Payments already made to the state governments by ONGC based on interim Supreme Court orders (Rs 2,562 crore) shall be adjusted in the accounts as expenditure. Based on this settlement, the Supreme Court has disposed of the case on February 20. &amp;quot;It has absolved ONGC of outstanding royalty demand by the Governments of Gujarat and Assam amounting to Rs 9,796 crore and potential interest claim of Rs 2,868 crore,&amp;quot; he added.","Assam government, Business, diesel, Dinesh K Sarraf, government, Gujarat, LPG, oil, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Oil India","government,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,oil,Oil India,Gujarat,Dinesh K Sarraf,Assam government,LPG,diesel",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/govt-bails-out-ongc-oilrs-22000-cr-royalty-liability_8569761.html

The cash outgo will go towards acquiring the government holding as well as buying an additional 26 percent stake in HPCL via an open offer.HPCL has an equity base of 1.01 billion shares. At today&amp;amp;rsquo;s closing price of Rs 561.10 on the National Stock Exchange, its market capitalisation comes to roughly Rs 56,671 crore.&amp;amp;nbsp;While the government will get Rs 29,134 crore for selling its 51.11 percent stake, ONGC will have to cough up another Rs 14,813 crores for another 26 percent share. Financially, it should not be a difficult exercise for ONGC to service since it sits on reserves of Rs 1,47,574 crore as on March 31, 2016, as per its annual report for the financial year. On Monday, the Economic Times reported that the government would soon move a Cabinet note for ONGC to take control of HPCL, paving the way for creation of a state-owned oil behemoth. The challenges to the gigantic exercise will be more administrative and legal than financial. Both ONGC and HPCL were formed by Acts of Parliament and the stake sale will thus need Parliamentary approval, a not-so-easy exercise in an opposition-dominated Upper House. In his Budget speech for 2017-18 on February 1, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the government proposed &amp;quot;to create an integrated public sector &amp;amp;lsquo;oil major&amp;amp;rsquo; which will be able to match the performance of international and domestic private sector oil and gas companies.&amp;quot; Examples of such oil and gas behemoths abound. Saudi Arabia's Aramco and Norway's Statoil are among those. &amp;quot;We see opportunities to strengthen our CPSEs through consolidation, mergers and acquisitions. By these methods, the CPSEs can be integrated across the value chain of an industry. It will give them capacity to bear higher risks, avail economies of scale, take higher investment decisions and create more value for the stakeholders. Possibilities of such restructuring are visible in the oil and gas sector,&amp;quot; Jaitley said in his Budget speech. The government has so far followed a policy that kept oil and gas exploration companies as separate entities from their refining and marketing counterparts. While Oil India and ONGC explore in India and abroad for oil and gas assets (ONGC overseas through its subsidiary ONGC Videsh), refining and marketing operations are undertaken by Indian Oil Corp Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd and GAIL India Ltd.

2017-02-27T16:40:29+05:30,ONGC,webtech_news18,ONGC-HPCL merger gives India heft in global M&amp;amp;A scene,"Jaitley, in his Budget speech, had spoken of creating oil majors which would be able to match the performance of international and domestic private sector oil and gas companies.","Shishir Asthana Moneycontrol Research  The Cabinet on Wednesday gave an in-principle nod to Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) to buy out government&rsquo;s 51.1% stake in Hindustan Petroleum Ltd (HPCL).  Reports peg the deal at Rs 29,000 crore and the company will also have to pay an additional Rs 15,000 crore to buy shares from the market, according to the takeover code. The government is, however, trying to avoid a situation which triggers takeover code.  Also, the government has smartly used the opportunity to raise money and meet its divestment target. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had set a divestment target of Rs 72,500 crore for FY18.  ONGC has around Rs 25,000 crore in cash and has a leverage of 0.30 thus putting it in a comfortable position to raise the money for the acquisition. For HPCL the price will find a support at the acquisition price level, at least till the time that the open offer is on.  Jaitley, in his Budget speech, had spoken of creating &lsquo;oil majors&rsquo; which would be able to match the performance of international and domestic private sector oil and gas companies.  There is no doubt that an integrated oil company, extending from oil exploration and production to refining adds more value than a standalone refining and marketing company or a standalone oil exploration company.  An integrated entity is able to cushion the volatility of the crude oil market far better than a standalone company. Capturing the entire value chain from oil to fuel smoothens the earnings of the company.  Combining its 15 million tonnes in Mangalore Refineries &amp;amp;amp; Petrochemicals Ltd with the 23.8-million-tonnes HPCL would make ONGC the third largest refiner in the country. ONGC produces around 26 million tonnes of oil and 22.5 billion cubic meters of gas.  All global-sized oil companies are integrated players. Generally fuel and petrochemical feedstock prices move with a lag to the crude oil price thus the loss from a drop in oil revenues can be delayed by higher prices of the finished products.  With oil prices likely to remain low given a slowdown in the global economy and excess supply, a merger with HPCL would give ONGC much-needed growth. Similarly, for HPCL it would need to lock its oil supply as it goes on an expansion spree.  The merger, however, does not mean that HPCL will consume ONGC&rsquo;s production. Each refinery is designed on a range of crude oil from various oil wells across the globe. A refinery selects its oil depending on the complexity of the refinery and the products that it plans to produce. There does not seem to be any major operational benefit from the merger.  The biggest advantage from the merger will be a stronger balance sheet. Both the companies would need this to bid for larger-sized oil wells. The bigger oil fields that are up for grabs globally are often beyond ONGC&rsquo;s reach.  With few oil finds in India and the huge requirement for oil in the country, the government intends to secure oil assets globally to prevent the country from any oil shocks in future.  While the intentions are noble, the government will have to ensure that the merged entities are given enough freedom to take quick decisions on acquisitions and bureaucratic hurdles do not result in lost chances as was the case in the past.","Arun Jaitley, Business, buy out, divestment target, Finance Minister, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, HPCL, Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, oil majors, ONGC","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,ONGC,buy out ,Hindustan Petroleum Corporation,HPCL,divestment target,Finance Minister,Arun Jaitley,oil majors,Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/comment-an-ongc-hpcl-merger-would-give-india-heftglobal-ma-scene_8562761.html

ONGC will pay USD 995.26 million for three discoveries in the KG-OSN-2001/3 block that are under trial production since August 2014. Another USD 200 million will be paid for six other discoveries for which GSPC has been finalising an investment plan to bring them to production. &amp;quot;ONGC Board has approved execution of farm-in/farm-out agreement with GSPC in respect of acquisition of 80 per cent Participative Interest (PI) and Operatorship in the NELP-III block KG-OSN- 2001/3,&amp;quot; a company statement said here. ONGC had on December 23 last year agreed to acquire the stake of Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC). Thereafter, &amp;quot;the two companies, after several rounds of discussions and legal due diligence, have agreed to the terms and conditions to be incorporated in the Farm-in / Farm-out agreement&amp;quot;, the statement said. The Farm-in/Farm-out agreement sets forth the modalities to be followed to effect the assignment of PI and change of Operatorship with the approval of the Government as per the existing Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and Joint Operating Agreement of the block, it said. Besides the payout to GSPC, ONGC will have to pay for the entire development cost of the six discoveries which may run into at least a couple of billion dollars. GSPC, which had a debt of Rs 19,716.27 crore as on March 31, 2015, has so far made 9 gas discoveries in the Bay of Bengal block. Of these, three - KG-08, KG-17, KG-15 - commonly known as Deendayal West (DDW) fields - have been approved for development. But against an approved field development plan (FDP) cost of USD 2.75 billion, GSPC seen a huge cost-overrun, incurring USD 2.83 billion as on March 31, 2015. Additionally, it had incurred an exploration cost of USD 584.63 million, taking total expenditure as on March 31, 2015 to USD 3.41 billion. As per the requirement of the FDP, 12 more development wells are yet to be completed which would further escalate the project cost. The trial production from the DDW field commenced in August 2014, but the average production achieved is only 19.45 million standard cubic feet per day against a targeted commercial production of 200 mmscfd. Commercial production has not commenced as production rate has not yet stabilised. The DGH approved FDP had envisaged commercial production from December 2011. The official said FDP for the six remaining discoveries -- KG-16, KG-22, KG-31, KG-21, KG-19 and KG-20SS, is under review of GSPC. As per the approved FDP of DDW fields, the estimated oil and gas in place (OGIP) was 1.952 trillion cubic feet (tcf). Jubilant and Geo Global Resources (GGR) own 10 per cent stake each in the block.","Business, Deendayal West, GSPC, KG-basin natural gas block, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, PTI","PTI,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,GSPC,KG-basin natural gas block,Deendayal West",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-board-approves-pact-to-acquire-gspc-stake-for-usd12-bn_8552881.html

The Board of ONGC approved an investment of Rs 4,104.63 crore in development of R-Series fields including revival of R-12 (Ratna), the company said in a statement. Ratna field was discovered in 1979 and put on production in 1983 which continued till 1994. The Government awarded the contract for development of Ratna and R-Series fields in 1996 to a consortium led by Essar Oil. However, the contract could not be signed due to various issues and in March last year the Government reverted the Ratna &amp;amp;amp; R-Series fields to ONGC for development and production. Out of 37 structures in the Ratna-R Series field, which is located about 130-km offf Mumbai, 8 structures were found to be oil bearing and only one R-12 (Ratna) field was under exploitation during the period 1982 to 1994. The remaining R- series structures are yet to be monetized, it said. ONGC said first oil is expected by 2018-19 but the peak out of 14,583 barrels per day is expected to be achieved in 2019-20. The field will produce a cumulative of 8.39 million tons of oil and 1.696 billion cubic meters of gas during the project life. ONGC Board also approved redevelopment of Santhal field in Gujarat at a cost of Rs 1,162.56 crore. The field located in Mehsana Asset in North Gujarat was discovered in 1971 and put on production in 1974. ONGC will use enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques to double recovery rate from current 17 per cent. After the project, cumulative oil production from the field is expected to be 20.46 million tons by 2029-30. The company will invest another Rs 546.15 crore in development of B-147 field in western offshore. &amp;quot;The field, discovered in March 1991, is a marginal field which would have been otherwise uneconomical to develop on a standalone basis. However, after creation of infrastructure in the nearby fields, there is an opportunity to develop this field by utilising existing surface facilities in an optimised cost environment,&amp;quot; the statement said. The field will produce 0.489 million tons of oil and 0.708 billion cubic meters of gas during the project life with peak oil and gas production estimated at about 1,576 barrels of oil per day and 0.25 million standard cubic meters per day of gas. The project is scheduled for completion by November 2019. Another Rs 511.30 crore will be spent in development BSE-11 block in western offshore to produce 1,000 barrels of oil per day, 1,808 barrels of condensate a day and peak gas production of 0.34 mmscmd. ONGC said another Rs 1,002.67 crore would be investment in 4th Phase Development of NBP field in western offshore to produce 2.08 million tons of more oil. B-147, BSE-11 block and NBP field will be completed by November 2019.","Business, developing four oil and gas projects, Essar Oil, invest, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Ratna field, State-owned","State-owned,Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,invest,developing four oil and gas projects,Ratna field,Essar Oil",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-to-invest-rs-7327-crfour-projects_8550461.html

The government, which holds 65.64 percent stake in the company, stands to gain about Rs 2,640 crore from tendering some of its shares in the buyback programme.  In a regulatory filing, ONGC said its board of directors approved &amp;quot;buyback of equity shares of the company not exceeding 25.29 crore being 1.97 percent of the total paid-up equity shares of the company at the price of Rs 159 per equity share payable in cash for an aggregate consideration not exceeding Rs 4,022 crore&amp;quot;.  This follows government pushing cash-rich PSUs to use their funds to buy back shares or pay a higher dividend. The government is looking to bridge budgetary deficit through higher receipts of dividend as well as selling its shares in PSUs in the buyback programmes.  ONGC will, however, not pay an interim dividend for now as it is left with almost no surplus after accounting for its capital expenditure, sources with knowledge of the development said.  ONGC shares closed almost flat at Rs 148.65 on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Thursday.  Stock buybacks refer to the repurchasing of shares by the company that issued them. A buyback occurs when the issuing company pays shareholders the market value per share and re-absorbs that portion of its ownership that was previously distributed among public and private investors.  Earlier this month, state-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) said it will buy back 29.76 crore shares for about Rs 4,435 crore and spend another Rs 6,556 crore on paying an interim dividend to shareholders.  The board of the country's largest oil firm, IOC approved buyback of up to 29.76 crore equity shares, or 3.06 percent, at Rs 149 per share.  Besides ONGC and IOC, at least half a dozen other central PSUs have disclosed share buyback programmes. Prominent among these include NHPC, Coal India, Oil India Ltd, BHEL, NALCO, NLC, Cochin Shipyard, and KIOCL.  The government is expected to participate in each of the share buyback programme of these PSUs with anticipation of netting over Rs 5,000 crore. IOC had also declared an interim dividend of 67.5 percent or Rs 6.75 per share for fiscal 2018-19. The total dividend payout, excluding tax, would be Rs 6,556 crore, of which the government will get Rs 3,544 crore plus the dividend distribution tax.  Last month, Oil India Ltd announced a buyback of 5.04 crore of its share for a little over Rs 1,085 crore.  The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), which has been set a target to raise Rs 80,000 crore for the government through stake sale in central public sector enterprises, had prodded all cash-rich PSUs to go for share buybacks.  PSUs having a net worth of at least Rs 2,000 crore and a cash balance of more than Rs 1,000 crore have to mandatorily go in for share buyback.","Business, Companies, ONGC","ONGC,business,companies",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-to-buyback-shares-for-rs-4022-cr_11866941.html

Also said to be on the agenda is the listing of its wholly-owned subsidiary ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL).  The government has pressured ONGC to buy back shares, as the move will help bridge the fiscal deficit. According to reports, the company may issue a buyback to the tune of Rs 4,800 crore.  While the company has wherewithal to fund such a buyback &ndash; it had cash and liquid investments to the tune of Rs 11,428 crore as of March 31, 2018 &ndash; the hefty buyback amount could tighten the company&rsquo;s planned capex.  An OVL listing will not only help raise funds for the buyback but also unlock value. OVL, whose reserves amount to 15 percent of ONGC&rsquo;s total reserves, does not disclose detailed numbers separately. A listing will make disclosures better. Valuations for the company are arrived at based on estimates reserves of OVL.  But a listing for the company is not without its challenges. Analysts argue the recent sharp fall in crude prices has made an unfavourable time to list OVL, and that crude price above $8o would have been a better time.  Moreover, ONGC might also have to segregate the overseas assets of OVL and this might attract transaction costs and tax expenses which would be an added burden for ONGC.  The crude price fall has also raised concerns about the impact on ONGC&rsquo;s revenues. The company management has argued that the current fall is not much of a concern for the company in the current year, as the average crude price for the year still remains above $ 65 per barrel. But sustained lower levels of crude might hamper the company&rsquo;s top line and profits in the coming year.

Natural gas is the fastest growing primary energy source in the world. It is the cleanest burning petroleum-based fuel and has wide applications -- from being used to generate electricity to the running of automobiles (CNG) and firing kitchen stoves.  With a view to reducing dependence on imports for meeting energy needs and cutting greenhouse emissions, India is looking at increasing consumption of natural gas by more than doubling its share in energy basket to 15 per cent in next few years.  Sources said, ONGC has been constrained by the current USD 3.36 per million British thermal unit price of gas fixed by the government, which is a third of the rate at which India imports gas in its liquid form (LNG).  This price is way below the cost of production for block GK-28/42 in Gulf of Kutch, off the Gujarat coast, Mumbai offshore block MB-OSN-2005/1 and Krishna Godavari basin block KG-OSN-2005/1, which cumulatively can produce about 10 mmscmd.  A similar amount of gas can come from onland discoveries and another 5 mmscmd can be added if investment to made in redevelopment projects of Mumbai High South, Neelam and B-127 cluster are made economical with the market price, they said.  ONGC had in 2017-18 fiscal year (April 2017 to March 2018) produced 23.484 billion cubic meters of natural gas, 6.3 per cent higher than 22.099 bcm output in the previous 2016-17 financial year.  This was the highest gas output by the company in five years and the growth rate was higher than the global average of 3-4 per cent year-on-year.  Sources said the company has stepped up efforts to bring newer fields into production after Prime Minister Narendra Modi set a stiff target of reducing oil import dependence by 10 per cent by 2022. India currently imports over 80 per cent of its oil needs.  The growth in output was largely contributed by C-26 Cluster fields, Daman and Vasai East fields in the western offshore as well as sub-sea well S2AB in the eastern offshore, sources said adding ONGC has charted out a plan to double the gas production at 42.7 bcm by 2021-22.  It is investing Rs 57,000 crore - one of the highest investments in the world in gas projects - in the high potential KG-DWN-98/2 project in the Bay of Bengal as well as in developing other discoveries on off the west coast.","Business, Companies, ONGC","ONGC,business,companies",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-gas-production-at-all-time-high70-mmscmd_11751241.html
2018-11-20T14:20:05+05:30,ONGC,PTI,"Natural gas production to rise by a third if output locked in ONGC, OIL fields opens up",State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) haven't been able to develop the discoveries or bring them to production as the current gas price of $3.36 per million British thermal unit (MMBtu) is way lower than the cost of production.  ,"India's natural gas production will rise by a third provided the output locked in a dozen fields of state-owned ONGC and OIL is opened up by giving remunerative market prices, people with knowledge of the matter said. India currently produces about 90 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) of natural gas and has ambitious plans to double output by 2022 to reduce its reliance on imports and replace some of the polluting liquid fuels to cut emissions.  Sources said, while the doubling of output would need huge capital expenditure of close to $10 billion in bringing to production discoveries in deep sea and frontier areas, discoveries already made by ONGC and OIL provide a low hanging fruit.  State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) haven't been able to develop the discoveries or bring them to production as the current gas price of $3.36 per million British thermal unit (MMBtu) is way lower than the cost of production.  Sources said, ONGC has about 35 billion cubic meters of recoverable reserves in discoveries in the shallow sea off Andhra Pradesh on the east and off Gujarat and Mumbai on the west coast blocks.  The three blocks in Krishna Godavari basin, Gulf of Kutch and Mumbai offshore can produce about 10 mmscmd of gas and an equivalent amount can be produced from its onshore discoveries in blocks like Bantumili, Mandapeta and Bhuvanagiri, they said.  About 5 mmscmd of production can be added by making some investment in existing fields like Mumbai High South, Neelam and B-127 Cluster in the Arabian Sea.  Oil India Ltd (OIL) has an onland discovery in the Krishna Godavari basin in Andhra Pradesh with over 3 billion cubic meters of recoverable reserves but needs a higher price to bring it to production.  Sources said, all these fields can be expeditiously developed and monetised in case pricing and marketing freedom is granted by the government.  ONGC and OIL want a price of over $6 per MMBtu to help them produce the gas without suffering any losses. In the absence of a viable gas price, they will have to mothball $3 billion projects, they said.  The BJP-led government had in October 2014, evolved a new pricing formula using rates prevalent in gas surplus nations like US, Canada and Russia to determine price in a net importing country.  Prices using this formula are calculated semi-annually.  While the government has allowed a higher rate of $7.67 per mmBtu for gas fields in difficult areas like the deep sea, ONGC's Krishna Godavari basin block KG-OSN-2004/1, which has about 15 bcm of recoverable reserves, is in shallow waters and does not qualify as a 'difficult field'.  Similar is the fate of Mumbai basin block MB-OSN-2005/1 on the western side. The block GK-28/42 in Gulf of Kutch is a nomination block which does not qualify for higher rates, they said.  The onland discoveries of ONGC and OIL too do not qualify for the higher rates.  While ONGC's KG block can produce a peak output of 5 mmscmd, the same from GK-28/42 is expected to be around 2.5 mmscmd. Peak output from MB-OSN-2005/1 is expected to a little less than 3 mmscmd.  Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha on March 20, 2017, had stated that the cost of production of natural gas in the prolific Krishna Godavari basin is between $4.99 to $7.30 per mmBtu.","Business, Dharmendra Pradhan, Oil India Ltd, ONGC","Dharmendra Pradhan,ONGC,Oil India,natural gas,India's natural gas production,Krishna Godavari basin,Mumbai High",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/natural-gas-production-to-rise-bythird-if-output-lockedongc-oil-fields-opens-up_11746561.html

","The government will next week launch the fourth tranche of CPSE Exchange Traded Fund to garner up to Rs 14,000 crore, investment banking sources said. The government has already raised Rs 11,500 crore in the earlier three tranches of the ETF, which functions like a mutual fund scheme.  The issue will open early next week and investors would get 3.5-4 percent discount over the issue price, the sources said.  The government is aiming to mop up Rs 8,000 crore, with a green-shoe option to retain either Rs 4,000 crore or Rs 6,000 crore from the fourth tranche of CPSE ETF, they added.  The number of scrips in the CPSE ETF has been increased to 11 state-owned companies, as against 10 earlier, with the entry of four new firms namely NTPC, SJVN, NLC and NBCC.  Three existing companies, GAIL, Engineers India Ltd (EIL) and Container Corporation of India, have been removed from the index as the government holding in these companies has fallen below 55 percent.  Since the weightage and scrip value of these three companies were higher, four new CPSEs had to be included in the ETF to replace them to keep the CPSE ETF index value at the same level.  The other seven bluechip PSUs in the CPSE ETF are ONGC, Coal India, IOC, Oil India, PFC, REC and Bharat Electronics.  CPSE ETF was set up in 2014 and the government has so far sold stake in the 10 companies in the basket in three tranches, thereby raising Rs 11,500 crore -- Rs 3,000 crore from the first tranche in March 2014, Rs 6,000 crore in January 2017 and Rs 2,500 crore from the third in March 2017.  In June 2018, the government garnered about Rs 8,400 crore through follow-on offer of another ETF -- Bharat 22 ETF, which comprises shares of 22 companies, including banks.  The government has mopped up over Rs 15,000 crore so far this fiscal through PSU disinvestment, which includes about Rs 5,300 crore from Coal India share sale, Rs 1,700 crore from IPOs of four PSUs -- RITES, IRCON, MIDHANI and Garden Reach Shipbuilders.

The companies are also expected to shell out Rs 10,000 crore by way of share buyback programs.  The proceeds of the sale along with buybacks will help achieve the Rs 80,000 crore divestment target, a fourth of which have already been achieved by the Finance Ministry. As part of the stake sale, the government will be looking to sell 5 percent of assets in ONGC, 3 percent in Indian Oil and about 10 percent in Oil India.  Once the divestment goes through, the government would earn approximately Rs 10,000 crore from ONGC (5 percent stake at Rs 156 per share), Rs 4,200 crore from IOC (3 percent stake at Rs 143.25 per share) and approximately Rs 2,300 crore from Oil India (10 percent stake at Rs 199.10). These shares would be offloaded at a 5 percent discount to the market rates.

2018-11-11T14:25:02+05:30,ONGC,PTI,Government mulls selling 149 fields of ONGC to private companies,This is the second attempt by the oil ministry to take away some of the fields of ONGC for private and foreign companies,"The government is mulling selling as many as 149 small and marginal oil and gas fields of ONGC to private and foreign companies and allow the state-owned firm to focus only on big fields, sources with knowledge of the development said.  On the anvil is some kind of extension of the Discovered Small Field (DSF) bid round where discovered and producing fields of Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) are auctioned to firms offering the maximum share of output to the government, sources said.  This is the second attempt by the oil ministry to take away some of the fields of ONGC for private and foreign companies.  In October last year, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) had identified 15 producing fields with collective reserve of 791.2 million tonnes of crude oil and 333.46 billion cubic meters of gas of national oil companies for handing over to private firms in the hope that they would improve upon the baseline estimate and its extraction.  The plan, however, could not go through as ONGC strongly countered the DGH proposal with its own suggestion that it be allowed to outsource operations on same terms as the government plan.  Sources said the current plan started as a follow up of the October 12 meeting called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to review domestic production profile of oil and gas and the road map for cutting import dependence by 10 per cent by 2022.  At a meeting, the ministry made a presentation showing that while 95 per cent of ONGC's production was from 60 large fields, 149 smaller fields contributed to a mere five per cent.  It was suggested at the meeting that these smaller fields could be given out to private and foreign firms and ONGC could concentrate on the big ones where it could rope in technology partners through production enhancement contracts (PEC) or technical service arrangements.  Sources said thereafter a six-member committee under NITI&nbsp;Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant was set up to give a proposal on the same.  ONGC, however, is opposed to the plan as it feels it should be allowed the same terms that the government extends to private and foreign firms in DSF.  The government gave out 34 fields to private firms by offering them pricing and marketing freedom for oil and gas they produced from the fields in the first round of DSF. A second round of DSF with 25 fields on offer is currently under bidding.  The fields offered in DSF were taken away from ONGC and Oil India Ltd on the pretext that they were lying idle and unexploited. But under the present proposal, the government plans to take away discovered and producing fields.  Sources said ONGC feels it too should be allowed to seek revenue sharing partnership for its fields. Field operations could be outsourced to foreign or private firms that offered the highest revenue or production share over and above a baseline production.  The ministry is reasoning that the areas where the fields discovered by ONGC were given to the state-owned firm on nomination basis.  In the proposal that was mooted in October last year, the plan was to give out 60 per cent stake in 15 fields -- 11 of ONGC and four of Oil India. These included Kalok, Ankleshwar, Gandhar and Santhal -- the big four oilfields of ONGC in Gujarat.  The DGH too had identified 44 fields of ONGC and OIL, which could take on partners for production enhancement work where bidders would get the 'tariff' that they bid as a return for increasing the output 'over the baseline production' for an initial period of 10 years.  The oil ministry is unhappy with the near stagnant oil and gas production and believes giving out the discovered fields to private firms would help raise output as they can bring in technology and capital, sources said.  It has been tasked by the prime minister to cut dependence on oil imports by 10 per cent by 2022 over 77 percent in 2014-15. But, the dependence has only increased and is now over 83 percent.  The privatisation is repeat of the infamous round in 1992-93 when medium sized discovered fields like Panna/Mukta and Tapti oil and gas field in the western offshore was given to now defunct Enron Corp of the US and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL).  As many as 28 fields were then awarded. Under this regime, ONGC was made licensee and given an option to farm in 40 percent of stake. The controversial privatisation under the then oil minister Satish Sharma had resulted in an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).

2018-11-01T15:40:04+05:30,ONGC,PTI,ONGC to draw perspective plan to integrate business,The nation's largest oil and natural gas producer is keen that its recent diversification into refining business as also petrochemicals is leveraged to full by integrating them with its core business.,"State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation will draw a new perspective plan to integrate recent acquisition HPCL and just commissioned petrochemical unit with its mainstay oil and gas exploration and production operations, its Chairman and MD Shashi Shanker said.  The nation's largest oil and natural gas producer is keen that its recent diversification into refining business as also petrochemicals is leveraged to full by integrating them with its core business.  &amp;quot;Post-acquisition of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) and commissioning of OPaL petrochemical plant at Dahej (in Gujarat), the company is drawing up a perspective plan to achieve proper synergies from the integration to maximize value, optimize cost and enhance efficiency,&amp;quot; Shanker said.  Synergies like the use of naphtha and other liquid hydrocarbons ONGC produces in the petrochemical unit set up by ONGC Petro-additions Ltd to produce value-added products as well as integrating refining stream of HPCL with company's existing subsidiary, Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd can result in huge opportunities, he said.  &amp;quot;ONGC today is chasing the hydrocarbon molecule to the last mile to derive the best value from it at the minimal cost,&amp;quot; he said, adding the company wants to put in place a well-knit strategic plan to bolster its presence in the entire hydrocarbon value chain.  ONGC earlier this year bought government's entire 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore, adding 23.8 million tonnes of annual oil refining capacity to its portfolio that made it the third-largest refiner in the country after Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Reliance Industries Ltd.  ONGC already is the majority owner of Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, which has a 15-million tonnes refinery.  The idea is to prepare a strategy to strengthen the integration further so that business growth is well diversified and risk well distributed to tide over the volatility due to fluctuations in global crude oil prices, he said.  The company has already mapped the production profile from its deepwater project in the KG Basin.  Block KG-DWN-98/2 will help double ONGC's gas production by 2022.  The current gas production stands at 23 billion cubic meters, which is expected to reach nearly 42 BCM by 2022. Oil production is also set to increase from the present level of 22 million tonnes to 25.6 million tonnes by 2022.  Also, the acquisition of Gujarat State Petroleum Corp's (GSPC) Deen Dayal West (DDW) block in KG basin has given ONGC ready infrastructure and facilities to produce from its high-pressure, high-temperature (HP-HT) fields.  This will also help in early monetization of other fields in the vicinity, which are a part of HP-HT Corridor, Shanker said. &amp;quot;Rig has already been deployed in Deen Dayal West (DDW) field for drilling and hydro-fracturing in order to boost production from this field&amp;quot;.  ONGC Group recorded a net profit of Rs 22,106 crore on a turnover of Rs 204,019 crore in 2017-18 fiscal year.  The business strategy being finalised would also focus on opening up of new basins to replenish reserves and increase its production, he said.  The company already operates in six out of seven discovered basins in the country.","Business, Companies, HPCL, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, ONGC","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,ONGC,business,companies,HPCL",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-to-draw-perspective-plan-to-integrate-business_11632621.html

This&nbsp;week started on an optimistic note amid mixed macroeconomic data, however, participation was limited mainly to the handful of index majors.  In the latter half of the last week, the market changed its tone completely and the benchmark indices plunged sharply after testing their crucial resistance zone.    Meanwhile, earnings announcements kept the participants busy as stocks witnessed volatile moves across sectors. Finally, Nifty settled at 10,303.55, down by 1.61 percent.  We expect volatility to remain high this week, too, thanks to the upcoming derivatives expiry and prevailing earnings season. Besides, movement on the currency front and indications from global markets will also be&nbsp;in focus.  On the earnings front, we have some of the big names viz. HDFC Bank, HCL Technologies, TVS Motors, Bajaj Auto, Maruti Suzuki India, Yes Bank, Dr. Reddy, ICICI Bank, ITC, Bharti Airtel, Biocon, and Kotak Mahindra Bank will be announcing their results during the week along with several others.  It&rsquo;s getting difficult for the participants with every passing day. The recent turmoil in NBFC stocks has changed the sentiment and it will take time to subside.  Besides, issues pertaining to currency deterioration and correction in the world markets are adding to the worries. Considering the scenario, we advise maintaining &ldquo;Sell on rise&rdquo; approach and keeping leveraged positions hedged. Also, we suggest focusing more on stock selection.  On benchmark front, we expect Nifty to continue within a broader range of 10,100-10,700 in the near future and either side decisive breakout would trigger the next directional move.  Here is a list of top three stocks which could give 6-7% return in the short term:  Aurobindo Pharma: Buy| Target: Rs 820| Stop-Loss: Rs 730| Return 7.9%  Aurobindo Pharma has been consolidating in a range of Rs 720-800 levels for the last one month after retesting its previous high of around Rs 825.  The overall chart formation combined with signals from the confirmation indicators are clearly pointing towards a strong up move ahead. Traders shouldn&rsquo;t miss this chance and accumulate in the range Rs 750-760. It closed at Rs 759 on October 22, 2018.

2018-10-21T14:45:03+05:30,ONGC,PTI,"'ONGC bought GSPC gas field stake for half the asking price of Rs 20k cr, replacement cost'",Former ONGC chairman DK Sarraf said the acquisitions is &amp;quot;strategic and of immense value proposition&amp;quot;.,"State-owned ONGC bought Gujarat State Petroleum Corp's (GSPC) stake in a KG basin gas block for USD 1.2 billion (about Rs 8,000 crore) when the replacement value of brand new assets built by the company is at least USD 1.5 billion and the asking price was Rs 20,000 crore, its former chairman D K Sarraf said.  With Opposition attacking the government over what it said was &amp;quot;pressure&amp;quot; exerted on ONGC to the&nbsp;first bail out the debt-laden GSPC and then using the company to meet the disinvestment target by selling majority stake in&nbsp;Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL), Sarraf, who headed the company when the two deals were struck, defended the acquisitions as &amp;quot;strategic and of immense value proposition&amp;quot;.  ONGC, he said, has been in the business of acquisition of oil and gas assets for decades, with its overseas investment arm ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) amassing 41 projects in 20 countries.  &amp;quot;And so when quality assets are available next door, it is better than going abroad,&amp;quot; he said referring to GSPC putting on sale its 80 per cent stake in Deen Dayal West (DDW) gas field in Block KG-OSN-2001/3 in the Bay of Bengal and the government offering 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL.  Sarraf said contrary to perception in some quarters, both the deals have been a win-win for all parties.  While in Deen Dayal field, ONGC got assets it can use to monetise its own gas discoveries in the neighbouring block, HPCL made it an integrated company, helping it hedge price risks that a pure exploration and production (E&amp;amp;amp;P) company faces, he said.  &amp;quot;They (GSPC) began by asking for Rs 20,000 crore (for stake sale). Negotiations dragged for one-and-half years and we were able to bring them down to Rs 8,000 crore. This when we consider that the value of offshore platforms and onshore gas receipt facility that GSPC has put in Krishna Godavari basin alone is USD 1.5 billion. Plus ONGC got gas reserves,&amp;quot; he said.  Deen Dayal block had not produced any gas before the December 2016 deal with ONGC.  Sarraf said ONGC, under him, found the GSPC block attractive as it could use the infrastructure in Block KG-OSN-2001/3 to bring to production Cluster-1 discoveries in its neighbouring KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5 block.  Also, the KG-OSN-2001/3 block infrastructure gave a backup option for Cluster-II discoveries in KG-D5 in case of disruptions, he said. &amp;quot;More importantly, it gave ONGC a ready experience in producing for high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) field.&amp;quot;  Deen Dayal is an HPHT field and ONGC has similar assets which it could bring to production using the experience of GSPC field, he said.  &amp;quot;GSPC was a strategic buy that brought in strategic value in the infrastructure it had, the gas reserves and the HPHT experience,&amp;quot; he said.  On HPCL, Sarraf said ONGC always had the ambition to become an integrated oil company by having businesses in downstream refining and fuel marketing.  It acquired Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) one-and-half decades back to fulfil that ambition and had wanted to use it to set up retailing stations.  &amp;quot;ONGC acquired a marketing licence but to set up a critical mass of 10,000 petrol pumps would have taken decades,&amp;quot; he said, adding HPCL presented a strategic advantage of leapfrogging to those levels.  Standalone E&amp;amp;amp;P companies are exposed to oil price risks and refining assets help balance such volatilities, he said.  After the Budget announcement of 2017 calling for setting up integrated oil companies, ONGC analysed options available. &amp;quot;IOC was too big a company to be considered for a merger. Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) in itself was headed towards becoming an integrated player with E&amp;amp;amp;P assets. So HPCL was the best buy, we thought,&amp;quot; he said.  ONGC, he said, paid a 10-12 per cent premium in its Rs 36,915 crore deal price which was many times less than a 50 per cent premium that controlling stake in strategic companies like HPCL would normally command.  The refining asset HPCL brought would hedge risks of low oil prices and the return of subsidy scheme where the government asks oil producers to subsidise fuel when prices shoot up, he said.","Business, India, oil companies","ONGC,HPCL,Gujarat state petronet",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/39ongc-bought-gspc-gas-field-stake-for-halfasking-pricers-20k-cr-replacement-cost39_11567701.html

2018-08-06T17:00:15+05:30,ONGC,PTI,ONGC board approves stake sale in Pawan Hans,ONGC board had first on June 29 approved exiting Pawan Hans and its interest being clubbed with the 51 percent government stake that is already on offer for sale.  ,"The board of ONGC has, for the second time in just over a month, approved selling its entire 49 percent stake in helicopter service provider Pawan Hans alongside government's privatisation bid, officials with direct knowledge of the development said.  ONGC board had first on June 29 approved exiting Pawan Hans and its interest being clubbed with the 51 percent government stake that is already on offer for sale.  Officials said ONGC on July 2 wrote to the government communicating the decision of the board but the Department of Disinvestment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), which is managing the sale of government stake, sought certain clarifications from the company.  Among others, ONGC was asked to state if the terms on which government stake sale is being sold would be acceptable to it. The company board at its meeting on August 2 endorsed such terms, they said.  This now paves way for the government to make a revised offer to sell 100 percent stake in Pawan Hans.  DIPAM, which floated the offer for sale for government's 51 percent stake in Pawan Hans twice in the last 10 months, is likely to issue an amended expression of interest (EoI) shortly.  Officials said ONGC is of the view that its investment in Pawan Hans is no longer strategic as it charter hires helicopters to ferry staff to its oil and gas locations, mostly offshore, through competitive bidding.  Of the 22 helicopters it currently has on hire, just seven or less than a third are from Pawan Hans.Pawan Hans owns a fleet of 46 helicopters.  ONGC board wants to consolidate business and focus resources on core oil and gas exploration and production business and not scatter bandwidth of management in unrelated businesses, they said.  Officials said when the government had first floated an offer to sell its 51 percent stake in October last year, ONGC made an offer to DIPAM that its 49 percent stake be also sold on same terms.  At that time, the company was told to get its board approval. Meanwhile, the government in early April withdrew its offer for sale as only two bidders including Indian helicopter major Global Vectra Helicorp and US-based Continental Helicopters made an offer.  A revised offer for sale was floated later that month, which fetched about half a dozen bidders.  DIPAM is of the view that a revised offer for sale would have to be floated as some bidders may have been deterred by 51 percent stake and would now prefer to bid when 100 percent is being offered.  Pawan Hans operates seven Dauphin N3 Helicopters for ONGC's offshore operations. These helicopters, based at Juhu airport, Mumbai and Rajahmundry, undertake passenger crew change service and production trips on a regular basis to meet the offshore requirements of the state-owned oil and gas producer.","Business, Current Affairs, DIPAM, India, ONGC","ONGC,ONGC stake in Pawan Hans,ONGC approves Pawan Hans stake sale,DIPAM,privatisation bid,expression of interest",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-board-approves-stake-salepawan-hans_11258921.html
2018-08-06T14:15:08+05:30,ONGC,PTI,"High operating profit to help ONGC cut borrowings, says Moody's",The rating agency in its base case assumed an average oil price for the remainder of the year of between $45 and $65 per barrel and expects ONGC to maintain retained cash flow/net debt above 30 percent.,"Oil and Natural Gas Corp's (ONGC) highest ever pre-tax quarterly profit (EBITDA) provides cash flow to the state-owned firm to reduce borrowings, Moody's Investors Service said today. For the April-June quarter of the current fiscal, ONGC reported 47.2 percent increase in EBITDA or operating profit to Rs 14,240 crore.  &amp;quot;The increase in EBITDA was largely driven by higher crude oil prices, as well as the depreciation of the Indian rupee,&amp;quot; Moody's said.  In a report, the global rating firm said the government has decided against asking ONGC to share in the cost of any fuel subsidies. &amp;quot;If it had done so, such a request could have partly negated the impact of the increase in oil prices.&amp;quot;  The government's decision, it said, is credit positive because it provides ONGC with cash flow to reduce its borrowings.  ONGC increased its borrowings by about Rs 25,000 crore in January 2018, when it acquired a 51.11 percent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd for Rs 36,915 crore.  &amp;quot;If oil prices stay above $70 per barrel for the remainder of the year and the government refrains from asking ONGC to share the costs of any fuel subsidies, we expect ONGC to generate a consolidated free cash flow of more than Rs 20,000 crore after likely capital spending of Rs 30,000 crore and dividend payments of Rs 9,500 crore. The company could reduce part of its acquisition debt by using this free cash flow,&amp;quot; it said.  The high levels of free cash flow will improve ONGC's financial flexibility, especially at a time when the company is unlikely to reduce its borrowings by selling its 13.77 percent stake in Indian Oil Corp (IOC), given that the share prices of IOC have fallen by about 25 per cent since September 1, 2017.  ONGC's 13.77 percent stake in IOCL is currently valued at Rs 22,500 crore.  Moody's said the government could, however, ask ONGC to share fuel subsidies in the next few quarters or alternatively, look for higher dividends.  &amp;quot;Any such move by the government would constrain ONGC's free cash flow and debt reduction, which will be credit negative,&amp;quot; it said.  The rating agency in its base case assumed an average oil price for the remainder of the year of between $45 and $65 per barrel and expects ONGC to maintain retained cash flow/net debt above 30 percent.  Debt reduction from free cash flow generation because of high oil prices and the absence of subsidy sharing will provide the company with a buffer to absorb declines in oil prices, it said.  While ONGC has only reported standalone financial results, its consolidated EBITDA &mdash; which includes the results of ONGC Videsh Ltd, ONGC's international exploration and production business &mdash; will also benefit from the increase in oil prices.  However, the refining businesses of the company (HPCL and Mangalore Refining and Petrochemical Ltd) will likely report weaker earnings for Q1 2019 versus Q4 2018 because regional refining margins were lower by about USD 1 per barrel, Moody's added.","Business, Companies, India, ONGC","ONGC,EBIT,debt reduction ,crude oil prices,fuel subsidies",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/high-operating-profit-to-help-ongc-cut-borrowings-says-moody39s_11257821.html

","State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) today said it has plugged a gas leakage on an unmanned offshore installation in Mumbai High South oil and gas field, around 180-km off the Mumbai coast.  The gas leakage was observed in one of the unmanned wellhead platforms S1-6, the company said in a statement without saying when the leak was detected.  &amp;quot;A team of ONGC engineers with support from Indian Navy successfully plugged the gas leakage,&amp;quot; it said.  Mumbai High is the ONGC's top oil and gas producing asset, lying in a water depth of 75 metres in the Arabian Sea.  The field, which started production in 1974, is divided into two -- Mumbai High North and Mumbai High South.  ONGC said after the leak was detected, the platform team immediately initiated all remote actions to shut down the well platform and to bleed off the pressure in the pipelines. Fire-fighting vessels were instantly deployed near the platform to provide water blanketing by continuously spraying water.  ONGC said its team could not land on the unmanned facility by helicopter or be transferred by a multi-support vessel due to bad weather conditions with high wind speeds of up to 35 knots, swell of 3.5 metres and strong surface currents in the sea.  &amp;quot;Having exhausted all available options to transfer ONGC team to S1-6 Platform, ONGC approached Indian Navy for help. After detailed discussions between ONGC and Indian Navy, it was decided to winch down ONGC team with the help of Indian Navy commandos,&amp;quot; it said.  'Seaking' helicopter N555 of the Indian Navy reached ONGC process platform and took ONGC technical team to S1-6. &amp;quot;Braving rough weather, the team identified the leakage source successfully and safely plugged it within one hour making the well ready to flow.

2018-07-18T21:35:20+05:30,ONGC,PTI,"Cabinet tweaks pre-NELP oil blocks, reduces ONGC burden of levies","The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) also extended the special dispensation of marketing and pricing freedom to natural gas produced from areas in the North Eastern region, Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told reporters here.  ","The Cabinet today tweaked pre-1999 oil and gas contracts to provide for proportionate sharing of statutory levies like royalty and cess between the operators of an area, and not put the entire burden on state-owned ONGC.  The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) also extended the special dispensation of marketing and pricing freedom to natural gas produced from areas in the North Eastern region, Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told reporters here.  Besides, income tax benefits have now been extended to all the 28 oil and gas fields awarded before the advent of the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) in 1999.  The decisions would unlock investments and boost oil and gas production, he said.  The government, he said, had awarded some discovered oil and gas fields to private firms in the 1990s with a view to attracting investments in the country.  To incentivise such investments, the liability of payment of statutory levies like royalty and cess was put on state-owned firms, who were made licensees of the blocks. ONGC and Oil India Ltd were allowed right to back in or take interest of 30-40 percent in the fields, but were liable to pay 100 percent of the statutory levies.  This, Pradhan said, led to fresh investments getting stalled as the state-owned firms were not keen to incur more liabilities.  To correct this, the CCEA has decided that &amp;quot;statutory levies including royalty and cess will now be shared in proportion to the participating interest of the contractor in pre-NELP exploration blocks&amp;quot;, he said, adding that this would impact seven such fields.  Also, the levy so paid has been made cost recoverable with prospective effect. It means that like capital and operating expense, the statutory levies can now be first recovered from the sale of hydrocarbons before sharing the profits with the government.  &amp;quot;This will benefit pre-NELP exploration blocks in which fresh investment for additional development and production activities is expected as sharing of royalty and cess, and cost recoverability of same will help in making additional investment commercially viable for licensee company -- ONGC/OIL,&amp;quot; he said.  These are the same conditions that ONGC had insisted upon in 2010 when Vedanta bought Cairn Energy plc's 70 percent stake in the prolific Barmer basin oil block in Rajasthan. ONGC, which held 30 percent stake in the block, gave approval to the deal only when Vedanta agreed to pay its share of royalty and cess.  Royalty for onland block is presently 20 percent. An equivalent amount of cess is also levied.  Pradhan said based on recommendations in 'Hydrocarbon Vision 2030 for North East', the Government has extended timelines for exploration and appraisal period in 10 operational blocks of region considering geographical, environmental and logistical challenges.  &amp;quot;The exploration period has been increased by two years and appraisal period by one year,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Also, to stimulate natural gas production in the region, the government has allowed marketing, including pricing freedom for natural gas, to be produced from discoveries which are yet to commence production as on July 1, 2018.&amp;quot;  The CCEA also decided to extend tax benefits under Section 42 of Income Tax, 1961 prospectively to operational blocks under pre-NELP discovered fields for the extended period of the contract.  Section 42 of Income Tax allows the companies to claim 100 percent of expenditure incurred under a production sharing contract (PSC) as tax deductible for computing taxable income in the same year.  While signing PSC of pre-NELP discovered fields, 13 contracts out of 28 contracts did not have provision for tax benefit under Section 42 of Income-tax Act. Now, this will bring uniformity and consistency in PSCs and provide incentive to the contractor to make an additional investment during the extended period of PSC, he said.  Pradhan said the CCEA also relaxed the timeline from seven days to 15 days for giving written notice to notify the occurrence of a force majure event in a PSC.  &amp;quot;The approvals given today are expected to help in ensuring the expeditious development of hydrocarbon resources,&amp;quot; he added.  // 1){for(var t=document.createDocumentFragment();e.childNodes.length&amp;gt;0;)t.appendChild(e.childNodes[0]);e.parentNode.replaceChild(t,e)}else e.firstChild?e.parentNode.replaceChild(e.firstChild,e):e.parentNode.removeChild(e)}function r(e){if(e)try{for(var t=e.querySelectorAll(&amp;quot;.gr_&amp;quot;),r=t.length,i=0;i","Business, Current Affairs, Economy, India, Oil India Ltd, ONGC","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,ONGC,Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs,CCEA,Dharmendra Pradhan,New Exploration Licensing Policy,NELP,Oil India Ltd,Vedanta,Hydrocarbon Vision,Income Tax,production sharing contract,PSC,Section 42,North East India",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cabinet-tweaks-pre-nelp-oil-blocks-reduces-ongc-burdenlevies_11162781.html

It said that air transport service operators would also include the non-scheduled operators which hold a valid air operator permit issued by regulatory authorities in India.  However, to several other queries, it said the details would be provided at the request for proposal stage.

As per a new mechanism approved by the government in October 2014, the price of domestically produced natural gas is to be revised every six months -- April 1 and October 1 -- using weighted average of rates prevalent in gas surplus markets like Henry Hub (US), National Balancing Point (UK excluding Russia), Alberta (Canada) and Russia.  Using this formula, the price for April to September came to USD 3.06 per mmBtu as compared to USD 2.89 in previous six months.  &amp;quot;Our average cost of production is about USD 5.14 per mmBtu. It comes to about USD 3.59 per mmBtu without taking into account return on capital,&rdquo; the official said. &amp;quot;Gas production is now a loss-making business as irrespective of cost of production we have to continue paying royalty and other taxes.&amp;quot;  Prices have been less than USD 4 since October 2015. &amp;quot;Natural gas is no more a profitable business because cost of production is very significantly higher than current gas prices,&amp;quot; the official said. ONGC, he said, has sought a review of the natural gas pricing formula.  India's largest natural gas producer is demanding a floor or minimum price of natural gas be fixed at USD 4.2 per mmBtu for the business to make economic sense.  The official said ONGC's significant discoveries in KG basin and Gulf of Kutch would need higher price to bring them to production.  Gas discoveries in the shallow sea off Andhra Pradesh on the east, and off Gujarat on the west are economically unviable to produce at the current government-mandated price of USD 3.06, he said, adding that in the absence of a viable gas price, it will have to mothball the USD 1.5-billion projects.  The official said the Krishna Godavari basin block KG- OWN-2004/1 is in shallow water and does not qualify as a 'difficult field', which get higher gas price of USD 6.78 per mmBtu. On the western side, the block GK-28 in Gulf of Kutch is a nomination block which does not qualify for higher rates, he said.  While the KG block will produce a peak output of 5.35 million standard cubic metres per day, the same from Gulf of Kutch block will be around 3 mmscmd. It would take a minimum three years to bring the gas finds to production.  The combined output is about 14 percent of the ONGC's current output of 60 mmscmd. He said the KG block discoveries are in water depth of just about 8-metres, developing which is costly since ultra- shallow rigs are scarce and therefore expensive.  ONGC also has a couple of smaller fields with a total expected peak production of 1.1 mmscmd, which cannot viably produce at the current domestic gas prices.  Natural gas constitutes around 45 percent of ONCG's total crude oil and natural gas production volume. It produces around 75 percent of the country's natural gas output.","Business, Companies, gas production, ONGC","ONGC,business,companies,gas production",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-logs-rs-4000-cr-lossgas-production-due-to-capprices_10970721.html

The oil major reported a 37 percent year-on-year (YoY) jump in net profit at Rs 5,915.12 crore on the back of higher oil prices. The company realised $66.71 per barrel of crude oil it produced from nominated fields, up from $54.91 a barrel it earned in January-March 2017.  Gas price realisation was up 15.6 percent at $2.89 per million British thermal unit.  Reacting to the Q4 result, CLSA raised its 12-month target price to Rs 240 from Rs 225 earlier, which translates in an upside of nearly 38 percent from Wednesday&rsquo;s close of Rs 173.95.  Jefferies and Nomura maintain their minimum target price of Rs 200, which translates in an upside of over 14 percent from current levels.  We have collated recommendations from various global brokerage firms after declaration of its Q4 results:  CLSA: Buy| Raise target price to Rs 240 from Rs 225  CLSA maintains a buy rating on ONGC but raised its 12-month target price to Rs 240 from Rs 225 earlier post Q4 results. EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) and net profit was a miss due to higher operating expenses and larger exploration write-offs.  Higher crude price led to a 6 percent hike in EPS. CLSA assumes upstream companies to bear all subsidies above Rs 40,000 crore. Recent reports of a formula with no subsidy till $70 per barrel is positive for the company.  ONGC is attractively priced at current levels as the risk-reward ratio is favourable. The stock is pricing Brent of US$53/bbl.  Jefferies: Buy| Target: Rs 225  Jefferies maintains a buy rating on ONGC post Q4 results with a target of Rs 225. The global investment bank lifted FY18 std. EPS by 11 percent on a YoY basis, but consolidated EPS, which included HPCL, lagged. Valuations remain inexpensive at 10.2x FY18 P/E when Brent averaged $58.  Nomura: Buy| Target: Rs 200  Nomura maintains a buy rating on ONGC post Q4 results with a 12-month target of Rs 200. It was a weak quarter for ONGC. The global investment bank prefers OMCs compared to upstream companies. The near-term market focus/concerns will be on government measures.

2018-05-24T13:05:13+05:30,ONGC,PTI,Windfall oil tax on ONGC in offing to soften fuel prices,"Under the scheme, oil producers, who get paid international rates for the oil they produce from domestic fields, would have to part with any revenue they earn from prices crossing USD 70 per barrel mark.","The government may levy a windfall tax on oil producers like Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) as part of a permanent solution it is working on for moderating the spiralling retail prices of petrol and diesel. The tax, which may come in form of a cess, will kick in the moment oil prices cross USD 70 per barrel, sources privy to the development said.  Under the scheme, oil producers, who get paid international rates for the oil they produce from domestic fields, would have to part with any revenue they earn from prices crossing USD 70 per barrel mark.  The revenues so collected would be used to pay fuel retailers so that they absorb spikes beyond the threshold levels, they said.  This may be accompanied by a minor tinkering with excise duty rates to give immediate relief to consumers. States too would be asked to cut sales tax or VAT to show a visible impact on retail prices.  Sources said the thinking in the government is to levy cess on all oil producers - both public and private sector - so as not to attract criticism of stifling state-owned explorers. A similar tax was considered in 2008 when oil prices were on the rise but the idea was dropped after stiff opposition from private sector firms like Cairn India.  Windfall tax, they said, is levied in some of the developed countries globally. The UK in 2011 raised the tax rate to be applied to North Sea oil and gas profits when the price is above USD 75 per barrel.  China on April 1, 2006, began levying the special upstream profit tax on domestic oil producers to redistribute and allocate the windfall income enjoyed by the oil companies and subsidise disadvantaged industry and social groups that are most affected by soaring crude oil prices. It in 2012 raised the windfall tax threshold to USD 55 per barrel.  Sources said the windfall tax is one of the options being considered by the government as a permanent solution to dealing with the problem of spike in oil prices.  This follows reluctance on part of the finance ministry to cut excise duty as it has to ensure adequate funds are available to social welfare schemes in the election year. In particular, resources have to be arranged for the National Health Protection Scheme (NHPS) that aims to provide health insurance cover of Rs 5 lakh to every eligible household.  Yesterday, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had stated that the government will take a long-term view on the retail prices of petrol and diesel, which have touched record high, instead of having an ad hoc measure.  Petrol and diesel prices were raised for the 11th day in succession today as the state-owned oil firms gradually passed on to the consumer the increased cost of international oil that had accumulated since a 19-day freeze was imposed just before Karnataka elections.  Since the time the hiatus ended on May 14, rates have gone up by Rs 2.84 a litre in case of petrol and Rs 2.60 in diesel. Petrol costs Rs 77.47 a litre in Delhi and diesel Rs 68.53. Sources said a USD 70 per barrel threshold for the windfall tax is sufficient to cover for capital expenditure requirement of ONGC and other oil producers.  Incidentally, ONGC and Oil India Ltd had till June 2015 provided for up to 40 per cent of the annual fuel subsidy bill. This they did by way of providing discounts on crude sold to downstream refining and marketing companies, IOC, BPCL, and HPCL. This discount helped the retailers make good a part of the losses they incurred on selling petrol and diesel below cost.  The government raised excise duty nine times between November 2014 and January 2016 to shore up finances as global oil prices fell, but then cut the tax just once in October last year by Rs 2 a litre.  The Centre levies Rs 19.48 as excise duty on a litre of petrol and Rs 15.33 on diesel. State sales tax or VAT varies from state to state. Unlike excise duty, VAT is ad valorem and results in higher revenues for the state when rates move up.","Business, Companies, fuel prices, ONGC","ONGC,business,companies,fuel prices",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/windfall-oil-taxongcoffing-to-soften-fuel-prices_10932461.html

Consolidated net profit in 2017-18 fiscal at Rs 981 crore was 29.6 per cent higher than Rs 757 crore in the previous financial year, the company said in a statement.  OVL is an unlisted company and as such is not obligated to release quarterly earning numbers.  The firm, which has 41 projects in 20 countries spanning from Venezuela to New Zealand, produced 11 per cent more crude oil at 9.35 million tonnes in FY18. Natural gas output was also up 10 per cent at 4.81 billion cubic metres.  &amp;quot;The incremental production was mainly from Vankorneft and Sakhalin-1 projects in Russia; Brazil's BC-10 project, CPO-5 block of Colombia and due to the acquisition of 4 per cent stake in the Lower Zakum Concession project in UAE during the year,&amp;quot; the statement said.  The board of directors of the company proposed a final dividend of Rs 2 per share for the 2017-18 fiscal, up from 1.4 a share paid in the previous year.  OVL said it along with Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Bharat Petro Resources Ltd in February acquired 10 per cent stake in Lower Zakum Concession, offshore Abu Dhabi -- the first acquisition by an Indian firm in UAE. The 10 per cent stake was split between OVL, IOC and BRPL in 40:30:30 ratio.  The field produces around 419,000 barrels of oil per day and share of Indian companies is around 42,000 bpd. OVL's share is around 16,800 bpd, it said.  During the year, the company also completed an acquisition of 30 per cent interest in an exploration acreage in Namibia.  ONGC Videsh Vankorneft Pte Ltd (OVVL), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of OVL, took 30 per cent stake in Namibia Petroleum Exploration License 0037 on October 3, 2017 for Blocks 2112A, 2012B and 2113B from Tullow Oil of UK.  Tullow with its remaining 35 per cent participating interest shall continue to be the operator of the license. Pancontinental Namibia (Pty) Ltd with 30 per cent interest and Paragon Oil and Gas (Pty) Ltd with 5 per cent are other partners in the license.  Also, an exploration block in Israel was awarded to an Indian consortium comprising of OVL, Bharat Petro Resources Ltd (BPRL), IOC and Oil India Ltd (OIL).  OVL said Russia has granted a 30 years extension to the Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) of Sakhalin-1 block from 2021 to 2051. The company holds 20 per cent stake in the field operation by Exxon.  Elsewhere, Government of Mozambique has accorded approval for the development plan for the Golfinho-Atum natural gas field in the Area 1 block located in the Rovuma Offshore Basin of Mozambique.  &amp;quot;The plan outlines the integrated development of the Golfinho-Atum field through an initial two-train onshore liquefaction plant with a total processing capacity of 12.88 million tonnes per annum,&amp;quot; OVL said.  The Golfinho-Atum Project will also supply initial volumes of approximately 100 million cubic feet of natural gas per day for domestic sales for Mozambique's industrial development and thereafter make close to 13 million tonnes of LNG annually for exports to nations like India.","Business, Companies, International Results, ONGC, ONGC Videsh","ONGC Videsh,business,companies,ONGC",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ovl-fy18-net-profit29higher-oil-production_10932181.html

This subsidy sharing ended in June 2015 with global oil prices plummeting.  But the risk of them being asked to once again bear a part of the subsidy is looming with the recent rise in international oil rates,&nbsp;Moody's&nbsp;said in a report today. &nbsp;&amp;quot;Because of the government's widening fiscal deficit, ONGC and OIL could be asked to bear part of the Indian government's fuel subsidy for oil, if prices stay above USD 60 per barrel for the fiscal year ending March 2019,&amp;quot; Moody's Senior Vice President Vikas Halan said.Moody's said the government could intervene to address record high prices of petrol and diesel by reducing the excise duty on these products, especially if oil prices stay high.  These taxes makeup over 20 percent of the retail selling prices and were increased in 2016 when oil prices fell.  ONGC and OIL, it said, have not contributed to fuel subsidies since June 2015, but have in previous years paid for over 40 percent of the country's annual subsidy bill.  &amp;quot;The net impact of the subsidy sharing will be manageable for ONGC and OIL, even if the two companies are required to bear the entire shortfall between budgeted and actual amounts for the fiscal year ending March 2019,&amp;quot; Halan said.  The government freed petrol price from its control in June 2010 and diesel in October 2014. It now provides a limited subsidy on LPG and kerosene. Even on LPG, the government from August 2017 stated to raise per cylinder selling price in steps, allowing for a maximum price increase of Rs 4 per bottle per month to gradually eliminate the subsidies. As a result, the LPG selling price increased to Rs 491 per cylinder in April 2018 from Rs 445 a cylinder in June 2017.  Moody's said if ONGC and OIL are obligated to contribute the entire subsidised amount exceeding the government's budgeted figure for 2018-19 fiscal, such a requirement would constrain their net realised prices to USD 52-56 per barrel, which is only marginally lower than or equal to the USD 56 for fiscal 2018.  It estimated that fuel subsidies could total Rs 34,000 crore to Rs 53,000 crore in current fiscal, the highest since fiscal 2015, assuming Brent crude oil prices average USD 60-80 per barrel.  The government has budgeted for Rs 25,000 crore of fuel subsidies in 2018-19, leaving a shortfall of Rs 9,000-28,000 crore, which could be met by ONGC and OIL entirely, or in part, if the government increases the budget allocation for these subsidies.  As for the oil marketing companies Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL), Moody's says that these companies have been asked to share less than 1 percent of total fuel subsidies since fiscal 2012, and it is unlikely that the proportion of such costs will rise.  On the issue of price deregulation, Moody's says the government is unlikely to reverse fuel pricing deregulation because it remains committed to reforms.  It noted that most petroleum products are sold at market-linked prices in India, except liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene.

2018-05-17T14:43:32+05:30,ONGC,PTI,ONGC capital spending not impacted by oil price: Moody's,"In a report, Moody's said while ONGC did not reduce capital spending on oil and gas exploration and production, it halted the pace of its international expansion as a response to the oil price slumping from USD 140 per barrel to under USD 40.","Defying a global trend, India's flagship national oil company ONGC did not cut its capital spending on exploration and development after oil prices collapsed between 2014-16, Moody's Investors Service said today.  In a report, Moody's said while ONGC did not reduce capital spending on oil and gas exploration and production, it halted the pace of its international expansion as a response to the oil price slumping from USD 140 per barrel to under USD 40.  &amp;quot;National oil companies (NOCs) worldwide strived to cut costs, adjust growth strategies or sell assets since the 2014-16 collapse in oil prices, just as oil companies without state sponsors have done,&amp;quot; the rating agency said in a report.  The decline in oil prices did not significantly affect Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), which saw its consolidated EBITDA for 2015-16 decline by only 16 percent compared to the same period three years earlier.  Moody's said this because ONGC's share of India's fuel subsidy burden offset that decline.  &amp;quot;ONGC was more exposed to the decline in natural gas prices, which nearly halved in India during that period as gas prices fell internationally,&amp;quot; it said.  Despite the oil price decline, ONGC did not reduce its capital spending on exploration and development, Moody's said. &amp;quot;However, the company halted the pace of its international expansion from early 2014 to mid-2016, when it resumed overseas acquisitions, including its completion of a 26 percent stake in CSJC Vankorneft, the owner of (Russia's) Vankor Field and North Vankor license, for USD 1.9 billion (after adjusting for cash profits),&amp;quot; it said.  All of ONGC's overseas acquisition activity has been in line with the Government of India's strategic objective of ensuring energy security for the country, which relies on imports for nearly 80 percent of its oil consumption.  Moody's estimated a capex of USD 7-7.5 billion for ONGC in the year to March 2019. This compares to USD 5.6 billion spending in 2014-15 and USD 12.3 billion in 2017-18. ONGC's spending in 2017-18 was higher because of one-off acquisition of the government's stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL).  To help improve the vertical integration profile of its business, ONGC in January acquired 51.1 percent of HPCL, India's third-largest refining and marketing company, from the government for Rs 36,915 crore. The government sold the stake to help reduce its fiscal deficit.  In the report that examined how changes in policy and structure since the oil price collapse will affect some of the largest NOCs worldwide, Moody's said NOCs globally have adjusted to a more moderate band of oil prices since the transforming price collapse of late 2014 to early 2016.  &amp;quot;Every NOC's own circumstances depend on a host of factors, such as the strength of support from its government sponsor, and the company's ability to control local markets,&amp;quot; it said.","Business, Companies, Moody's Investors' Service, ONGC","ONGC,business,companies,Moody's Investors Service",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-capital-spending-not-impacted-by-oil-price-moody39s_10905221.html
2018-05-07T15:27:39+05:30,ONGC,PTI,ONGC clocks 6.3% rise in gas production,This is the highest gas output by Oil and Natural Gas Corp in five years and the growth rate is higher than the global average of 3-4 percent year-on-year.,"State-owned ONGC registered 6.3 percent increase in natural gas production in 2017-18 and is on track to double the output by 2022, a top company official said. It produced 23.484 billion cubic meters of gas in 2017-18 as against 22.088 bcm in 2016-17, he said.  This is the highest gas output by Oil and Natural Gas Corp in five years and the growth rate is higher than the global average of 3-4 percent year-on-year.  ONGC has stepped up on bringing newer fields into production after Prime Minister Narendra Modi set a stiff target of reducing oil import dependence by 10 percent by 2022. India currently imports over 80 percent of its oil needs.  The overall gas production, which includes production from the joint ventures, registered a growth of 5.8 percent at 24.610 bcm, as against 23.270 bcm in the previous year.  &amp;quot;This is the highest ever overall growth in percentage terms since 2001-02,&amp;quot; he said. The company is targeting gas production of 24.41 bcm during the current financial year and incur an investment of around Rs 7,000 crore.  While the main incremental growth stand-alone basis came from western offshore, the onshore fields have also contributed substantially despite natural decline coupled with several other constraints.  During the last financial year, ONGC's offshore gas production stood at 17.845 bcm against 16.883 bcm produced in 2016-17. The onshore registered a production of 5639 bcm gas in the last fiscal year against the production of 5.205 in the previous fiscal.  The growth in output was largely contributed by C-26 Cluster fields, Daman and Vasai East fields in the western offshore as well as sub-sea well S2AB in the eastern offshore, he said.  From the onshore fields, there has been an increase in production particularly from Ramnad area in Cauvery Asset. There has also been a considerable increase in associated gas production from Ankleshwar and Assam Assets.  When reached for comments, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker said the company has been aggressively pursuing the gas production growth in line with the government's drive for cleaner gas economy.  He said the company has charted out a mission to double the gas production at 42.7 bcm by 2021-22.  &amp;quot;The production growth last year is only a testimony to that goal,&amp;quot; he said, adding the company was on track to meet the target.  The total investment in the ONGC's ambitious gas projects stands at Rs 57,000 crores, which is one of the highest investments in the world as far as the gas projects are concerned. This investment includes the high potential KG-DWN-98/2 project which is being implemented on a fast track basis. First gas from the project is targeted for 2019.  The job for the early monetisation of discoveries both from the west and the east coast has been rigorously monitored at the highest level in order to ensure that the company's ambitious gas production goal is achieved on schedule, Shanker said.  The official said ONGC has drastically reduced gas flaring during the last fiscal, leading to considerable savings. The gas flaring stood at 1.92 percent in 2017-18, lowest since 1999-2000. This is only technical flaring and due to non-availability of customers like in the previous years.","Business, Companies, gas, ONGC","ONGC,business,companies,gas",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-clocks-63-risegas-production_10869301.html

India's top oil and gas producer has shortlisted Schlumberger, Halliburton and GE subsidiary Baker Hughes for raising output from Kalol field in Gujarat and Geleki field in Assam, according to tender document floated by the company.  Other oilfield service providers meeting pre-qualification criteria can also bid for the job by May 25, it said.  The service providers will be paid a fee for raising output beyond an agreed baseline production.  &amp;quot;To achieve the objective of production enhancement of oil and gas from mature fields, ONGC invites global oil and gas service providers having firm commitment to invest and processing capabilities to bid,&amp;quot; the document said.  &amp;quot;The service provider will be required to invest in capital expenditure and operating expenditure to increase production from the existing 'baseline' production.&amp;quot;  ONGC is looking to raise domestic output quickly to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi's target of cutting import dependence by 10 per cent by 2022. India currently imports over 80 per cent of its oil needs.  Originally, ONGC had on December 7, 2016 signed a Summary of Understanding (SoU) to give Kalol field to Halliburton and Geleki field to Schlumberger for raising production above the current baseline output. Though the contracts were signed in presence of Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, ONGC rescinded them last year on fears of courting controversy for handing fields on nomination basis.  Thereafter, the company in June 2017 floated an expression of interest (EoI) from service providers for undertaking production enhancement.  &amp;quot;Following are the names of vendors meeting the pre-qualification criteria (of EoI) : Schlumberger Asia Services, Halliburton Offshore Services Inc and Baker Hughes Singapore PTE Ltd,&amp;quot; the firm said in the document seeking final bids by May 25.  The 15-year Production Enhancement Contract (PEC) will require the oilfield service producer to commit to investing in capital expenditure and operating expenditure to increase production from the existing 'baseline' output.  A tariff will be paid in USD per barrel of oil and USD per million British thermal unit for gas for any incremental hydrocarbon produced and saved over the baseline.  The baseline shall be prepared by ONGC and vetted and certified by a third party of international repute.  All the oil and gas produced will belong to ONGC and the service provider arrangement is being entered into to get the best technology available, sources said.  Besides Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes, ONGC was also in talks with Weatherford International.  Sources said based on the experience of Kalol and Geleki, the PEC model may be extended to other onshore fields.","Business, Companies, ONGC","ONGC,business,companies",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-shortlists-schlumberger-halliburton-baker-for-boosting-output-at-2-oilfields_10859381.html

India's&nbsp;exploration and production (E&amp;amp;amp;P) of deep water blocks policies are in line with Statoil's move to come to the country, a&nbsp;top Indian government official aware of the development told the paper. The Norwegian state-run firm is also interested at investing in offshore wind projects in India. The firms had called on or expression of interest (EoI) with the Indian government last week for the first such project in the Gujarat coast.  &ldquo;We have had very good discussions with the Norwegian government representatives and Statoil as well.

People familiar with the matter in India and Sudan said ONGC had filed a claim for USD 98.94 million, in what they said was a first for the South Asian nation's top oil and gas explorer against any government. They declined to be identified because they weren't authorised to discuss the matter with media.  At the centre of the dispute is ONGC's 25 percent stake the company acquired in the Greater Nile Oil Project (GNOP) in Sudan in 2003. Other stakeholders include China's China National Petroleum Corp with a 40 percent stake and Malaysia's Petronas with a 30 per cent share.  &amp;quot;Yes, we have filed an arbitration as our dues have been pending for years,&amp;quot; said N K Verma, managing director of ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL). &amp;quot;Notwithstanding this arbitration we will continue to work with Sudan going forward,&amp;quot; he said, declining to provide details on the timing and location of any hearings, or the amount being sought.  The current arbitration is only for a part of pending dues that add up to about USD 425 million, sources said, adding ONGC has sued the government as the contracts were backed by sovereign guarantees.  ONGC will also file arbitrations for the remaining outstanding amount in due course, said a company official, who declined to be identified.  Officials in Sudan said contacts and negotiations with ONGC were being lined up.  &amp;quot;We have addressed the company (ONGC) to show our commitment to serious negotiation and we (have) set up a committee to determine the time frame to pay back the sum in installments,&amp;quot; said Bekheet Ahmed Abdullah, under-secretary for Sudan's Petroleum Ministry.  SANCTIONS IMPACT  OVL's stake in the Greater Nile Oil Project (GNOP) comprised Blocks 1, 2 and 4, and the firm also agreed to build a 1,500-kilometre pipeline to Port Sudan on the Red Sea. But in 2011 South Sudan broke away from Sudan, after decades of civil war, and took control of blocks 1A, 1B and a part of block 4.  Meanwhile, because of years of trade sanctions imposed on Sudan by the U.S. - only lifted in 2017 - Khartoum found it difficult to secure oil for its refineries, and asked foreign companies including OVL to sell their share of oil from the blocks to the African nation.  In 2016, OVL signed a separate agreement with Sudan for the sale of its share of GNOP oil. Sudan has not yet paid USD 90.81 million to ONGC for purchases of oil in 2016 and 2017, according to people familiar with the matter.  ONGC Videsh had expected Sudan to clear the dues after lifting of the US sanctions last year.  &amp;quot;We are committed to pay the money but due to the sanctions imposed on Sudan, we are facing problems in making payment,&amp;quot; said Sirajuddin Hamid Yousuf, Sudan's ambassador to India.  &amp;quot;The sanctions were eased on October 12, 2017 but we still cannot have normal banking transactions with India and others,&amp;quot; he said.  &amp;amp;nbsp;","Business, Companies, India, World News","Oil and Natural Gas Corp's (ONGC),ongc,sudan,united states,us,ongc videsh,Greater Nile Oil Project (GNOP),China's China National Petroleum Corp",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-files-arbitration-claim-against-sudan-over-unpaid-oil-dues_10789981.html
2018-04-10T15:59:20+05:30,ONGC,PTI,Iran agrees to take all of OVL's Farzad-B gas,Iran previously conditioned granting rights to develop the Farzad-B fields to OVL on Indian firms buying all of the gas produced at the imported-LNG equivalent rate.,"Iran has agreed to take the gas produced from the ONGC Videsh Ltd-discovered Farzad-B field in the Persian Gulf, but differences remain over returns on investments made by the Indian firm.  Iran previously conditioned granting rights to develop the Farzad-B fields to OVL on Indian firms buying all of the gas produced at the imported-LNG equivalent rate.  This proposition, which involved an investment of USD 11 billion in first developing the field and then setting up a facility to convert it into liquid gas (liquefied natural gas or LNG) for shipping to India, was considered very expensive, sources privy to the development said.  Iran has now written to OVL, agreeing to take delivery of all of the gas produced from Farzad-B offshore field at a landfall point in the Persian Gulf nation.  OVL, the overseas investment arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), too has written back accepting the offer and has asked Iran to detail the delivery point, they said.  Sources said Iran has stated that it will take all of the unprocessed natural gas and asked OVL to re-do the investment numbers.  OVL, which had in 2008 discovered the Farzad-B gas field, feels it can lower the upstream field development investment to under USD 4 billion from previously proposed USD 6.2 billion.  On top of the USD 6.2 billion investment, another USD 5 billion was to be invested for setting up the LNG plant.  Sources said OVL will now do just the upstream field development plan and no longer set up the LNG plant.  But the rate of return that Iran is offering to the Indian firm continues to be a hindering block.  On the face of it, Iran is offering 15 percent return on the investment made. But after considering the conditions attached, the return comes to 5-6 percent only, sources said.  Sources said the upstream investment would be lower as unlike the previous proposal, OVL would not be setting up any plant to process the gas produced from the field.  Farzad-B gas contains a high degree of sulphur and needs treating before it can be sold to users, they said.  OVL had last year made its 'best' offer to spend USD 11 billion in developing the Farzad-B field in the Persian Gulf as well as in building the infrastructure to export. The company has now agreed to do just the upstream field development part, leaving the marketing of the fuel to Iran.  Farzad-B was discovered by OVL in the Farsi block about 10 years ago. The project has so far cost the OVL-led consortium, which also includes Oil India Ltd and Indian Oil Corp (IOC), over USD 80 million.  The field has an in-place gas reserve of 21.7 trillion cubic feet, of which 12.5 Tcf is believed to be recoverable.  India and Iran were initially targeting concluding a deal on Farzad-B field development by November 2016 but later mutually agreed to push the timeline to February 2017. The deadline to wrap up negotiations was later targeted for September 2017. But, with deal stuck over pricing of gas, no new deadlines have been proposed.","Business, Companies, Farzad-B, Iran, ONGC, ONGC Videsh","Iran,ONGC,ONGC Videsh,business,companies,Farzad-B,LNG",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/iran-agrees-to-take-allovl39s-farzad-b-gas_10763561.html

The panel has also asked the government to formulate regulations for 100 per cent reservation of local people in Grade-III and IV posts in PSU firms of the state.  In its report submitted to the House yesterday, the Employment Review Committee of the Assam Assembly observed that the ONGC notification for recruitment to the 22 vacant posts did not follow a prescribed format in accordance with Rule 4 of the Employment Exchanges Act, 1959.  &amp;quot;As per the Supreme Court verdict, it is mandatory to intimate the employment exchange, which then should sponsor the name of the candidates. The ONGC Assam Asset did not give any scope to the Employment Exchange to sponsor the candidates against vacancies,&amp;quot; it added.  The committee also pointed out that the ONGC claimed to have issued notifications to 10 local employment exchanges, asking them to inform eligible candidates with valid registration numbers about the job vacancies, but when asked, ONGC could not provide the details of the applicants.  The Assembly panel advised the government to formulate overall recruitment policy, in accordance with findings of Gujarat Resolution, to provide jobs to local youths in PSU firms such as ONGC, OIL, Indian Railways and Coal India.  &amp;quot;During the course of discussion, the committee observed that there is no clear cut government policy regarding recruitment of local people, including PwDs, in the Grade-III and IV posts of public sector undertakings in Assam.  &amp;quot;The committee recommends that the department concerned should formulate policy for cent per cent recruitment of local candidates in Grade-III and IV posts in all PSUs of the state,&amp;quot; the report said.  The investigation by the Assembly panel also found that not a single member representing the government or the Skill, Employment &amp;amp;amp; Entrepreneurship Development Department was part of the selection committee, even as the norms suggest that the notification should have been forwarded to the department first for wider publicity.  &amp;quot;The committee noted that that the ONGC Assam Asset had mentioned in their advertisement that the 22 vacant posts for PwDs are for Assam, but did not specify who can apply for the posts (and) whether it is restricted to the candidates of Assam only&hellip;&amp;quot; the report said.  It asked the oil major to clearly mention that the Grade-III and IV PWD posts are reserved for the candidates of Assam while publishing the advertisements in future.  The review committee recommended that the existing 14 vacant posts for PwDs should be filled up through local employment echanges and sought the creation of 30 new Grade-III and IV PWD posts for the local people of Assam.  &amp;quot;The committee recommends that the Recruitment Board/Selection Committee of all PSUs and all public enterprises should consist of at least one member representing the government of Assam/Directorate of Skill, Employment &amp;amp;amp; Entrepreneurship Development, Assam, in the line with Oil India Ltd, Duliajan, Assam,&amp;quot; the report said.  The panel also said that the ONGC should associate itself with the local ITIs or polytechnic institutes to provide apprenticeship to the students so that can apply for Grade-III and IV posts in future.","Business, Companies, ONGC","ONGC,business,companies",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/anomaliesrecruitment-processongc-assembly-committee_10744901.html

The price paid to most of natural gas produced from domestic fields will be USD 3.06 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) for six months, beginning April 1, from current USD 2.89, according to a recent notification issued by oil ministry&rsquo;s Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell.  &amp;quot;Natural gas contributed around 45 percent of ONCG&rsquo;s total crude oil and natural gas production volume in fiscal 2017.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Assuming natural gas sales volume of around 10 billion cubic meters for the first six months of fiscal 2019 for ONGC and its joint venture partners, ONGC&rsquo;s natural gas revenue will increase 23 percent to Rs 80 billion (Rs 8000 crore) for the six months between 1 April and 30 September 2018, from a reported Rs 65 billion (Rs 6500 crore) the year before&amp;quot;, Moody&rsquo;s said in its credit outlook issued today.  The government revises domestic natural gas prices every six months using a pricing formula based on a volume-weighted annual average of prices prevailing in Henry Hub (US), National Balancing Point (UK excluding Russia), Alberta (Canada) and Russia, it added.  India&rsquo;s oil and gas producers, including ONGC, are unlikely to increase gas production over the next 12-18 months because most of the discovered resources will take at least another two to three years to reach production, the report opined.

In a letter to the Prime Minister last week, Pawan Hans Helicopters union All-India Civil Aviation Employees Union, has suggested to the government to first increase ONGC's stake from the present 49 percent and then go for a public issue as per the earlier five-year business plan instead of an outright sale, according to sources.  At the same time, the union also met civil aviation minister Suresh Prabhu and submitted a memorandum, opposing the decision to hand over a profit-making entity to private players &amp;quot;against its own disinvestment guidelines&amp;quot;.  Government had last October invited bids from private companies, including foreign ones, to buy out its entire 51 percent stake along with management control in Pawan Hans, a Miniratna under the administrative control of the civil aviation ministry. The remaining 49 percent stake is held by oil behemoth ONGC.  However, it reportedly failed to attract enough bidders and now the whole process is being revisited.  &amp;quot;We came to know from various newspaper reports that government had received very poor response for Pawan Hans. Considering this, we&rsquo;d request that the government consider as a second option which was suggested by the employees union in various letters to civil aviation and finance ministries and the PMO,&amp;quot; the union letter said.  Stating that the Pawan Hans is a profit-making entity since its inception and has been paying dividend each year, the union said &amp;quot;as per existing disinvestment policy, those units having a positive net worth, no accumulated losses and having earned net profit for three preceding consecutive years be required to achieve the mandatory listing norms of 25 percent public holding for listing on the stock exchange...&amp;quot;  Pawan Hans has been paying dividends to both government and ONGC, it said, adding, &amp;quot;total dividend it has paid out till date is Rs 2,345 crore from 1995-96 to 2015-2016 while the total taxes paid stand Rs 480 crore during this period.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;The management control of Pawan Hans can be given to ONGC by allowing it increase its stake and subsequently go in for a public issue to get government a much higher price from the sale of shares in stretches in the next five years with expansion and improved performance,&amp;quot; the letter said.  As government has considered and allowed similar units to participate in the process of strategic sale, it should allow Airport Authority, ONGC and HAL to participate in this process, it added.  &amp;quot;It is humbly submitted that it may not be the right time for strategic sale in the company as it is on growth path as well,&amp;quot; the union said.","Business, ONGC","Pawan Hans Helicopters,privatisation,ONGC,All-India Civil Aviation Employees Union,IPO",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/union-opposes-pawan-hans-sale-writes-to-pmo-to-look-at-ipo-instead_10700061.html
2018-03-25T12:45:12+05:30,ONGC,PTI,ONGC may buy out GAIL in OPaL,"GAIL had in 2008 picked up 19 percent stake in ONGC Petro-additions Ltd (OPaL), which was then building the mega petrochemical complex at Dahej in Gujarat.","State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) may buy out gas utility GAIL India Ltd in its Dahej mega petrochemical project in Gujarat to take full control of the recently commissioned plant.  GAIL had in 2008 picked up 19 percent stake in ONGC Petro-additions Ltd (OPaL), which was then building the mega petrochemical complex at Dahej in Gujarat.  But the project, which started in 2006, faced major cost and time overruns, which forced GAIL to restrict its equity contribution to the original Rs 996.28 crore. This investment in the expanded project cost meant that the gas utility's stake dropped first to 17 percent, then to 15.5 percent and now about 9 percent, sources privy to the development said.  &amp;quot;It doesn't make any business sense to hold such a small percentage stake and it is best that ONGC buys out GAIL in the project,&amp;quot; they said.  The 1.1 million tonnes plant, which at the time of conception was projected to cost Rs 12,440 crore, got completed only last year for about Rs 30,000 crore.  After GAIL in 2008 agreed to pick up 19 percent stake in OPaL, the project cost was in 2010 was revised to Rs 19,535 crore. It was couple of years later further revised upwards to Rs 21,396 crore with December 2013 set as the commissioning date.  Sources said when project cost was revised to Rs 19,535 crore, GAIL decided to restrict its participation to 17 percent. This was done because the company's board had powers to approve an investment of only up to Rs 1,000 crore.  Consequently, it decided to make an equity contribution of Rs 996.28 crore towards the 17 percent stake, they said.  But when the project cost went up further to Rs 21,396 crore, the promoter's equity contribution increased from Rs 5,860.5 crore to Rs 6,418.8 crore at 70:30 debt-equity ratio.  GAIL, sources said, is not inclined to make any additional equity contribution and has decided to cap its investment in OPaL at the capital it has already approved &mdash; Rs 996.28 crore. This, in the revised project cost, fetched it only 15.5 percent stake.  Now that the project cost almost touched Rs 30,000 crore, that investment is equivalent to only about 9 percent stake.  Sources said GAIL would, however, continue to hold rights to market 38 percent of the polymer and other chemicals produced by OPaL even at the reduced equity stake.  ONGC has funded almost all of the enhanced project cost after GAIL as well as Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC), which was to originally hold 5 percent stake, did not make more equity contributions.  ONGC had attributed the increase in project cost primarily to additional cost of Phase-II captive power plant and increase in cost of building the Phase-I electricity generating unit.","Business, Companies, GAIL, ONGC, OPaL","ONGC,GAIL,business,companies,OPaL",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-may-buy-out-gailopal_10699641.html

ONGC had borrowed money from banks to buy government's 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore.  &amp;quot;We traditionally have been a debt-free company and would like to return to that status as soon as possible. We have assets which can be monetised to payoff the debt,&amp;quot; he said.  ONGC holds 13.77 per cent stake in nation's biggest refiner Indian Oil Corp (IOC), which at today's trading price is worth close to Rs 26,000 crore. It also holds 4.86 per cent stake in gas utility GAIL India Ltd, which is worth over Rs 3,600 crore.  &amp;quot;We will sell sales in IOC and GAIL only when the price is right. And it is not possible to sell all the shares in one go,&amp;quot; he said, adding that an alternative to it is selling stake in ONGC-Petro Additions Ltd (OPaL).  OPaL's 1.1 million tonnes capacity petrochem plant at Dahej in Gujarat was commissioned last year and has reached 100 per cent capacity in February.  &amp;quot;We have invested Rs 30,000 crore in the project and always had plans to sell a minimum of 26 per cent stake in the project to a strategic investor,&amp;quot; the official said. &amp;quot;Now that the plant has come up well and stabilised, this is the time to monetise it.&amp;quot;  The official said several companies including some global giants have evinced interest in taking equity in the project. He however refused to name the firms due to commercial reasons.  Saudi and Kuwaiti firms are said to be interested in taking a stake in the project.  The project was originally conceived in 2006 and has witnessed cost and time overruns. It was initially planned to be built at a cost of Rs 12,440 crore but ended up with actual investment of Rs 30,000 crore.  ONGC was originally supposed to keep just 26 per cent stake while gas utility GAIL was to take 19 per cent. 5 per cent was to be taken by Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) and the remaining was to be sold to a strategic investor.  But GAIL ended up paying for only 9 per cent and GSPC for only 0.2 per cent. The remaining cost was borne by ONGC.  The official said ONGC already has government approval to sell its shareholding in IOC and GAIL but the company is waiting for the right price to offload the shares.  ONGC, which completed HPCL acquisition at the end of January, has been a zero-debt company and wants to retain that status. The short-term loan it availed of has provision to pre-pay without any penalty.","Business, Companies, HPCL, Oil and Natural Gas Corp, OPaL","Oil and Natural Gas Corp,OPaL,HPCL,business,companies",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-to-sell-opal-stake-to-fund-hpcl-buy_10624681.html

2018-03-04T11:00:34+05:30,ONGC,PTI,Proxy advisory firm questions exemptions in ONGC-HPCL deal,"Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) bought the government's 51.11 per cent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) for Rs 36,916 crore.","Proxy advisory firm IiAS has questioned state-owned ONGC seeking exemption from taking shareholders' nod for acquisition of the government's stake in HPCL, saying such leniency with regard to public votes is not warranted.  Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) bought the government's 51.11 per cent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) for Rs 36,916 crore.  The acquisition price of Rs 473.97 per share was finalised on January 20 and the deal was completed as an off-market transaction on January 31 and ONGC is now asking shareholders to ratify it, IiAS said.  The purchase qualifies as a related party transaction (RPT) as the government holds majority stake in ONGC and was selling its stake in HPCL.  IiAS said Section 188 of the Companies Act states that 'prior approval' is required for firms to enter into RPTs. In cases where such an approval was not taken, the Act allows for ratification till a period of three months.  &amp;quot;This is understandable for routine transactions which are in the ordinary course of business. But given the legal and operational complexities in rolling back stake purchases, as a good governance measure, ONGC should have refrained from going ahead with the transaction before the shareholder vote,&amp;quot; it said in a note.  On the company's assertion in the shareholder notice that seeking prior approval for a price sensitive deal was impracticable, it said, &amp;quot;This is unfathomable, given that the purchase has been under consideration for several months and there was no real urgency to close the deal.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;Questions to be asked: Why could ONGC not wait for shareholder approval before purchasing the stake? What happens if the resolution is defeated? Does the company have a plan in place to roll back the transaction in case the resolution is defeated?,&amp;quot; it asked.  Both the Companies Act and SEBI (LODR) Regulations 2015 exempt public-sector undertakings from seeking shareholder approval where the RPTs are conducted with another PSU. But there are no such exemptions for transactions between the government and a PSU.  &amp;quot;Despite this, SEBI, vide its letter dated November 30, 2017, has already granted exemption to ONGC from having to take shareholder approval. ONGC has also applied to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs for an exemption &ndash; once granted the current resolution (seeking shareholder nod) will be withdrawn. IiAS believes this renders otiose the entire exercise,&amp;quot; the note said.  IiAS said discerning shareholders who have taken the time and effort to analyse and vote will be left in the lurch if the resolution were to be withdrawn.  It went on to ask if ONGC should be given preferential treatment, and avoid the shareholder voting process.  Stating that PSU shareholders have expectations regarding governance standards, it said the current legal framework fails to provide a level playing field.  &amp;quot;The Government is often able to push its agenda forward, which might not always be in the best interests of the company's direct and immediate stakeholders,&amp;quot; it said.  The advisory firm said there is a need for greater introspection across the board. &amp;quot;In the listed space, there cannot be different standards for PSUs and private companies. It is time for the Government and regulators to bridge this governance gap,&amp;quot; it said.  While listing of PSUs is cited as the biggest driver of accountability and transparency, there is a big divergence in standards applicable for state-owned and private companies.  &amp;quot;In ONGC&rsquo;s case, the company is seeking regulatory exemptions. While IiAS supports the overall transaction, it believes that such leniency with regard to public votes are not warranted,&amp;quot; the note said.","Business, Companies, HPCL, ONGC","ONGC,HPCL,business,companies",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/proxy-advisory-firm-questions-exemptionsongc-hpcl-deal_10595161.html

With government also being a majority shareholder in ONGC, the acquisition fell in the definition of related party transaction for which shareholder nod is needed as per law, the company said in a shareholder notice seeking approval for the deal through a postal ballot.  &amp;quot;However, as a related party to the transaction, there will be no participation by the government of India in the postal ballot process,&amp;quot; it said. ONGC said it bought the entire shareholding of the government of India in HPCL at Rs 473.97 per share.  The transaction was consummated as an offmarket transaction on January 31, after which ONGC had become the holding company of HPCL, it said.  ONGC said it was seeking shareholder &amp;quot;ratification through postal ballot for acquisition of 77.88 crore equity shares, representing 51.11 per cent, in the paid-up capital of HPCL from Government of India (GoI)&amp;quot; since the GoI, being the promoter, is a related party.  A March 30, 2017, government notification specifies the limits for transactions beyond which related party transaction shall require approval of the shareholders.  With regard to the category of 'sale, purchase or supply of any goods or materials', limit has been prescribed as 10 per cent or more of turnover or Rs 100 crore, whichever is lower.  &amp;quot;The transaction between GoI and your company for sale and purchase of 51.11 per cent shareholding of the GoI in HPCL at its market capitalisation exceeded the threshold limit,&amp;quot; ONGC said in the notice to shareholders reasoning the approval. ONGC said the Companies Act of 2013 provides for ratification by shareholders within three months of any agreement entered without such explicit nod.  &amp;quot;Since the price per share was the critical element of the transaction and it was agreed only on January 20, 2018, and also incorporated in the 'share purchase agreement' entered into between the GoI and the company on that date, the prior approval was impracticable,&amp;quot; it said. &amp;quot;Accordingly, the present proposal seeking the ratification of the transaction by the members is sent.&amp;quot;  While ONGC is predominantly an upstream oil and gas production, HPCL is a oil refining and fuel marketing company. With acquisition of HPCL, ONGC would have presence across the entire value chain in the oil and gas industry and emerge as an integrated oil and gas company, the company said in the notice.  &amp;quot;The acquisition will bring synergies between both the companies.&amp;quot; ONGC said SEBI granted specific exemption to this transaction from making the mandatory open offer in such acquisition as the ultimate ownership of HPCL wasn't changing.  &amp;quot;The company has also applied to the ministry of corporate affairs for a clarification/exemption for related party transactions between the Government of India and government companies. Accordingly, in case the exemption/substitution notification is issued by ministry of corporate affairs before the last date for postal ballot process, the resolution shall be withdrawn as not being required in view of such exemption,&amp;quot; it said.  Late date for postal ballot is March 27. ONGC said its board commends the resolution for the ratification of the members.","Business, Companies, HPCL, ONGC","ONGC,business,companies,HPCL",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-seeks-shareholder-nod-for-hpcl-deal_10587441.html
2018-02-26T13:42:29+05:30,ONGC,PTI,ONGC says KG-D5 output delay due to policy changes,"Clarifying on its last week's filing to stock exchanges, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) said the new policies it had cited for a possible delay pertained to local purchase preference policy, steel policy and GST policy.","Oil producer ONGC has said it may miss the June 2019 target for starting production from its Krishna Godavari basin block due to new policies like GST and local purchase preference rules, including the one that mandates state-owned firms to source domestic iron and steel for infrastructure project.  Clarifying on its last week's filing to stock exchanges, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) said the new policies it had cited for a possible delay pertained to local purchase preference policy, steel policy and GST policy.  &amp;quot;The new policies concerning oil and mining sector, as referred in the reply of ONGC to NSE and BSE, though not amply clarified in the reply, were pertaining to policies like purchase preference policy, steel policy, GST policy etc. and not regulatory policy,&amp;quot; ONGC said in a statement.  While the ONGC Board had in March 2016 approved a USD 5.07 billion investment for bringing oil and gas discovered in the KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5 block in Bay of Bengal to production, new policies were formulated last year.  The Union Cabinet in May 2017 approved a policy that will prefer sourcing of domestic iron and steel for infrastructure projects by state-owned companies in a bid to boost Make in India.  Also, a policy has been formulated to give public enterprises purchase preference if their bid is within 10 per cent of the lowest price. Goods and Services Tax (GST) was also rolled out in July 2017.  Last week, ONGC informed stock exchanges that after its Board in March 2016 approved the field development plan (FDP), it began procuring goods and services such as drilling, completion of wells, creation of production and processing facilities and transportation pipelines.  &amp;quot;Meanwhile, introduction of various new policies concerning the oil mining sector led to deferment of tendering activities. As of now, the project schedules are being maintained as planned. However, due to very complex nature of the project, there is a possibility that the schedules may get exhausted which will only be known at a later date,&amp;quot; it had said.  The company had not given details of the policy changes. The delay will be for the second time due to government policies. ONGC had in 2014 announced plans to start gas production from 2018 and oil by 2019 but a final investment decision was made contingent upon government approving a remunerative price for the deepsea block as the prevalent rates were uneconomical.  But it was not before March 2016 that the government announced a new pricing formula for difficult areas, giving developers more than double the domestic rate.  Immediately after that ONGC Board approved the investment plan for Cluster-II group of discoveries in KG-D5.  The 7,294.6 sq km deepsea KG-D5 block has been broadly categorised into Northern Discovery Area (NDA - 3,800.6 sq km) and Southern Discovery Area (SDA - 3,494 sq km). The NDA has 11 oil and gas discoveries while SDA has the nation's only ultra-deepsea gas find of UD-1. These finds have been clubbed in three groups - Cluster-1, Cluster-II and Cluster-III.  Gas discovery in Cluster-I is to be tied up with finds in neighbouring G-4 block for production but this is not being taken up because of a dispute with RIL over migration of gas from ONGC blocks. From Cluster-II, a peak oil output of 77,305 barrels per day is envisaged within two years of start of production.  Gas output is slated to peak to 16.56 million standard cubic meters per day by end-2021. Cluster-2A mainly comprises oil finds of A2, P1, M3, M1 and G-2-2 in NDA which can produce 77,305 bpd (3.86 million tonnes per annum) and 3.81 mmscmd of gas. Cluster 2B, which is made up of four gas finds - R1, U3, U1, and A1 in NDA - envisages a peak output of 12.75 mmscmd of gas. Peak output is likely to last 7 years.  Cluster-3 is the UD-1 gas discovery in SDA. UD-1 lies in water depth of 2400-3200 meters and its development would be taken up after an appropriate technology is found.","Business, Companies, India, ONGC","ONGC,business,companies,India",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-says-kg-d5-output-delay-due-to-policy-changes_10568621.html

The three companies have until May to submit their proposals for what ONGC is calling a &amp;quot;production enhancement contract&amp;quot; for an oilfield in Assam and another in Gujarat.  &amp;quot;The shortlist is ready. We will now share our data on the two fields with these companies,&amp;quot; an ONGC executive said.  The executive - who did not wish to be named as ONGC has yet to make an official announcement - said the final contract is likely to be awarded by May.  Emails to Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes requesting comment on their participation were unanswered outside of U.S. business hours.  SOARING DEMAND, STRUGGLING OUTPUT  The government last September proposed selling a 60 percent stake in ONGC's producing fields to foreign companies to ramp up domestic oil and gas output and meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi's target of cutting oil imports 10 percent by 2022.  India's oil production has stalled below 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in recent years, even as oil demand has surged. That has resulted in its crude oil imports soaring, making it the world's third-biggest importer, behind China and the United States. In January, India's imports hit a record of almost 5 million bpd.  ONGC, which the government hopes to eventually build into a global giant like Exxon Mobil or a state-owned oil major like PetroChina, has often been criticized by analysts and New Delhi for failing to increase its production.  ONGC's output - most of it from fields that have been operating for more than 30 years - is declining at the rate of 7 to 8 percent a year. A major part of the company's capital expenditure is spent in efforts to pump more oil and gas to set off the yearly decline.  For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, ONGC's standalone crude oil production stood at 20.855 million metric tonnes (417,000 bpd), a one percent fall from the previous year.  Once the final contractor is chosen in May, the winning service company will be responsible for maintaining production at current levels, and also for boosting output incrementally from the two mature fields, the ONGC executive said.  &amp;quot;We will reimburse the operational expenses incurred and share some pre-determined amount on each barrel of incremental crude that the contractor will produce,&amp;quot; the executive said.  Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes will get access to ONGC's data rooms pertaining to its Kalol field in Gujarat and the Geleki field in Assam before submitting a final bid, according to the bidding document.  ONGC might replicate the model for other fields if this pilot exercise is a success, the executive said.  ONGC explored a similar move in 2016 and had signed agreements with Halliburton and Schlumberger aimed at enhancing production, but the agreements were later cancelled, according to reports in local media.","Business, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC)","Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC),oil service giants,output from domestic oil fields,Halliburton,Schlumberger,GE subsidiary Baker Hughes",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-short-lists-three-oil-service-majors-to-lift-outputtwo-fields_10547601.html
2018-02-19T17:45:25+05:30,ONGC,PTI,KG block production may be delayed due to regulatory changes: ONGC,"Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is investing USD 5.07 billion in KG-DWN-98/2, which sits next to Reliance Industries' flagging KG-D6 block in Bay of Bengal, with the target of bringing out first gas in June next year and oil in March 2020.","State-owned oil producer ONGC today said it may miss the June 2019 target for starting production from its KG-D5 block due to regulatory policy changes.  Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is investing USD 5.07 billion in KG-DWN-98/2, which sits next to Reliance Industries' flagging KG-D6 block in Bay of Bengal, with the target of bringing out first gas in June next year and oil in March 2020.  In a regulatory filing, ONGC said that after its board in March 2016 approved the field development plan (FDP), it began procuring goods and services such as drilling, completion of wells, creation of production and processing facilities and transportation pipelines.  &amp;quot;Meanwhile, introduction of various new policies concerning the oil mining sector led to deferment of tendering activities.  &amp;quot;As of now, the project schedules are being maintained as planned.  However, due to very complex nature of the project, there may be possibility that the schedules may get exhausted which will only be known at a later date,&amp;quot; it said.  The company did not give details of regulatory policy changes.  The delay will be for the second time due to government policies.  ONGC had in 2014 announced plans to start gas production from 2018 and oil by 2019 but a final investment decision was made contingent upon government approving a remunerative price for the deepsea block as the prevalent rates were uneconomical.  But it was not before March 2016 that the government announced a new pricing formula for difficult areas, giving developers a more than double the domestic rate.  Immediately after that ONGC board approved the investment plan for Cluster-II group of discoveries in KG-D5.  The 7,294.6 sq km deepsea KG-D5 block has been broadly categorised into Northern Discovery Area (NDA - 3,800.6 sq km) and Southern Discovery Area (SDA - 3,494 sq km).  The NDA has 11 oil and gas discoveries while SDA has the nation's only ultra-deepsea gas find of UD-1.  These finds have been clubbed in three groups - Cluster-1, Cluster-II and Cluster-III.  Gas discovery in Cluster-I is to be tied up with finds in neighbouring G-4 block for production but this is not being taken up currently because of a dispute with RIL over migration of gas from ONGC blocks.  From Cluster-II a peak oil output of 77,305 barrels per day is envisaged within two years of start of production.  Gas output is slated to peak to 16.56 million standard cubic meters per day by end-2021.  Cluster-2A mainly comprises of oil finds of A2, P1, M3, M1 and G-2-2 in NDA which can produce 77,305 bpd (3.86 million tonnes per annum) and 3.81 mmscmd of gas.  Cluster 2B, which is made up of four gas finds -- R1, U3, U1, and A1 in NDA -- envisages a peak output of 12.75 mmscmd of gas.  Peak output is likely to last 7 years.","Business, Companies, markets","ONGC,Oil and Natural Gas Corp,KG-D5 block,Reliance Industries,Bay of Bengal,field development plan,FDP,deepsea block",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/kg-block-production-may-be-delayed-due-to-regulatory-changes-ongc_10536181.html
2018-02-18T13:43:24+05:30,ONGC,Vaishali Karulkar,"OVL to bid for Iran's South Azadegan oilfield, rework Farzad-B cost",,"ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), will bid for development rights of Iran's giant South Azadegan Oilfield in direct competition with the likes of global giants like Shell, France's Total, Petronas of Malaysia and Russia's Gazprom.  OVL will also rework the USD 6.2 billion cost of developing the Farzad-B gas field in the Persian Gulf, which it had discovered a decade back, to get Iran to award rights of the field to it, sources privy to the development said.  OVL is one of the 34 companies Iran pre-qualified last year for development of South Azadegan field, which contains an estimated 33 billion barrels of oil in place, of which 6 billion barrels are deemed recoverable. The field currently produces about 80,000 barrels of oil per day (4 million tonnes per annum) and output is envisaged to touch 320,000 barrels a day (16 million tonnes).  Sources said OVL will make a formal bid when National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) opens a tender for developing the South Azadegan oilfield.  Other firms prequalified include Japan's Inpex Corp, China's CNPC, Eni of Italy, Sinopec of China and Russia's Gazprom, Lukoil and Rosneft.  Sources said OVL had last year made its 'best' offer to invest USD 11 billion in developing the Farzad-B field as well as in building the infrastructure to export the gas but Iran has deterred awarding the rights of the field to the Indian firm owing to differences over pricing of the fuel.  With the deal on the verge of collapsing, OVL has offered to do just the upstream part of bringing the field to production while leaving the marketing of the fuel to Iran, they said, adding that the upstream part is to cost USD 6.2 billion while another USD 5 billion will be required to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facility.  Iran believes the upstream investment should not be more than USD 5.5 billion.  Farzad B was discovered by OVL in the Farsi block about 10 years ago. The field in the Farsi block has an in-place gas reserve of 21.7 trillion cubic feet, of which 12.5 tcf are recoverable.  Yesterday, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan held talks with his visiting Iranian counterpart Bijan Namdar Zangeneh where he pressed for a stake for Indian companies in a producing oilfield and promised to raise crude oil import from the Persian Gulf nation in the year beginning April to reverse the reductions introduced in the current fiscal.  Zangeneh said he was &amp;quot;optimistic&amp;quot; about signing of an agreement awarding rights of Iran's giant Farzad-B gas field to its discoverer, OVL. A team of officials led by OVL will be visiting Tehran this week to renegotiate terms.  He said Indian public and private sector oil companies will in 2018-19 fiscal buy 0.5 million barrels of crude oil per day (25 million tonnes).  This will be 25 per cent more than current fiscal imports estimated at 370,000 barrels per day (18.5 million tonnes).  India had for the current fiscal cut oil imports from Iran by nearly 25 per cent over delays in award of Farzad-B development rights to OVL. In 2016-17, India had imported 510,000 barrels per day (25.5 million tonnes) of oil from Iran.  Pradhan said Iran has given &amp;quot;good incentives&amp;quot; on crude oil exports to India. &amp;quot;It will be beneficial for India to buy more crude from Iran rather than from other countries. We have agreed that India will buy more crude oil from Iran in coming days.&amp;quot;  Like the recent acquisition of 10 per cent stake in 20 million tonnes a year producing oil field in UAE, India made a case for a stake in a producing Iranian oil field, he said, adding that on Indian horizon was a field like South Azadegan.  &amp;quot;The deadlock we had on the viability of Farzad-B block, its size of capex, return, timeline, we discussed all the three issues. We have exchanged our positions. Next week our business delegation will go to Tehran to discuss all these issues,&amp;quot; he said.","Business, Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC), OVL","ONGC Videsh Ltd,ONGC,Iran,South Azadegan Oilfield,Shell, Total,Petronas,Malaysia,Russia's Gazprom,liquefied natural gas (LNG)",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ovl-to-bid-for-iran39s-south-azadegan-oilfield-rework-farzad-b-cost_10531661.html

2018-01-30T20:05:42+05:30,ONGC,PTI,Moody's affirms ONGC's stable ratings following HPCL buy,The transaction remains subject to requisite approvals from the shareholders of ONGC.,"Rating agency Moody's today affirmed the ratings for state-run ONGC as 'stable' following the oil major's recent acquisition of majority shareholding in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL).  The transaction remains subject to requisite approvals from the shareholders of ONGC.  ONGC has acquired 51.11 per cent equity stake in HPCL from the centre for a consideration of Rs 36,915 crore to be paid in cash by January 31, this year.  &amp;quot;Moody's Investors Service, affirmed Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd's (ONGC) 'Baa1' local and foreign currency issuer ratings, and the 'Baa1' ratings on the senior unsecured bonds issued by ONGC Videsh Ltd and ONGC Videsh Vankorneft Pte Ltd, both guaranteed by ONGC,&amp;quot; the rating agency said.  &amp;quot;The outlook on all ratings is stable,&amp;quot; it added. ONGC's 'Baa1' issuer ratings are primarily driven by its standalone credit profile.  Moody's noted that ratings reflects ONGC's position as the only integrated oil and gas company in India with significant reserves, production and crude distillation capacity, post the acquisition. Besides, it also incorporates substantial operating cash flow generation capacity as well as weakened but still appropriate credit metrics for its ratings following the HPCL acquisition.  Further, Moody's expects that the company will not be asked to share fuel subsidies as long as the oil prices stay below USD 60-65 per barrel.  &amp;quot;The rating outlook is stable reflecting Moody's expectation that the company will lower its borrowings through sale of stake in IOC and GAIL,&amp;quot; the agency said.  &amp;quot;Further, the stable outlook also incorporates our expectation of benign oil price environment and that the company's growth plan will continue to be executed within the tolerance level of its current ratings,&amp;quot; it added.  However, the agency noted that likelihood of a ratings upgrade for ONGC in the next 12 -18 months remains low given the high leverage.  Moody's said that ONGC may finance HPCL equity stake will be funded by up to Rs 25,000 crore of incremental borrowings, with the balance being cash on hand.  &amp;quot;The payment of acquisition price will result in ONGC's net borrowings increasing by Rs 36,915 crore, irrespective of the mix of debt and cash used for such payment,&amp;quot; it said.  Accordingly, post-acquisition, ONGC's proforma net borrowings for the fiscal year ending March 2018 will increase to Rs 1,26,500 crore as against Rs 47,200 crore without the acquisition.  It can be noted, post-acquisition the ONGC board had approved fresh debt raising of Rs 35,000 crore.  &amp;quot;ONGC's proforma credit metrics for fiscal 2018 will also weaken with retained cash flow/net debt declining to 28 per cent from 68 per cent without the acquisition,&amp;quot; the agency said.","Business, Companies, markets, Moodys, ONGC","ONGC,Moody's,Hindustan Petroleum Corporation,HPCL,Baa1,ONGC Videsh Ltd,ONGC Videsh Vankorneft Pte Ltd,IOC,GAIL",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moody39s-affirms-ongc39s-stable-ratings-following-hpcl-buy_10428361.html
2018-01-25T15:40:54+05:30,ONGC,PTI,"Govt may ask oilcos to share LPG, kerosene subsidy burden: India Ratings and Research",Producers Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd as well as gas utility GAIL were in past asked to bear between one-third to half of the under-recovery fuel retailers incurred on selling LPG and kerosene below market rate.,"As the crude oil prices rise, the government may ask upstream firms like ONGC to bear a part of the kerosene and LPG subsidies, India Ratings and Research said today.  Producers Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd as well as gas utility GAIL were in past asked to bear between one-third to half of the under-recovery fuel retailers incurred on selling LPG and kerosene below market rate.  This subsidy sharing scheme ended last fiscal.  In a statement on its view on ONGC buying out HPCL, India Ratings said given the sharp increase in international crude price, oil marketing companies may be required to bear a part of the under-recoveries.  This would be on the lines of past when the government capped the subsidy burden it was willing to share per kilogram and per litre on LPG and kerosene, respectively.  Any under-recovery over and above the level up to which the government can bear is to be borne by upstream and oil marketing companies, it said.  &amp;quot;Although there is no mathematical basis for deciding the share of the subsidy to be borne by upstream or oil marketing companies, upstream companies have historically shared the bulk of the remaining subsidy burden post the government share,&amp;quot; it said.  India Ratings said ONGC's acquisition of Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) will be credit neutral for ratings of HPCL.  ONGC, which is 68.94 per cent owned by the government, will acquire the government's 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL for Rs 36,915 crore.  &amp;quot;Thus, the government of India will indirectly own 35.23 per cent in HPCL,&amp;quot; it said in a statement.  Despite the change in ownership, HPCL will continue to operate as a separate entity with a strong brand. Its strategic importance to the government is likely to remain intact, given the company's role as the State's extended arm for fuel policy implementation.  &amp;quot;The acquisition of HPCL is likely to result in additional borrowings for ONGC,&amp;quot; India Ratings said, adding that the state-owned oil producer is likely to fund the acquisition by end-January 2018.  It could use one or more of the three sources for funding -- fresh debt, cash and cash equivalents, and monetisation of its stake in entities such as GAIL, Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Petronet LNG Ltd.  The combined value of its stake in the three entities is about Rs 34,400 crore.  For HPCL, the acquisition may result in some synergies in crude oil procurement with Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, which is 71.63 per cent owned by ONGC.  HPCL, along with HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd and MRPL, represented 15.3 per cent of India's total crude import volume of 249 million tonne.  Also, HPCL may be able to capitalise on ONGC's petrochemical expertise while expanding its footprint in the segment.  &amp;quot;The acquisition may result in the merger of MPRL with HPCL. This would be beneficial as it would allow the combined entity to leverage its purchasing power,&amp;quot; India Ratings said.  The combined entity would be the third-largest refiner in India, with a refining capacity of 43.1 million tones, behind IOC's 80.8 million tonnes and Reliance Industries Ltd's 62 million tonnes.  India Ratings said HPCL may have to resort to additional borrowings in case it was to acquire ONGC's stake in MRPL for cash. ONGC's stake in MRPL is worth Rs 16,400 crore.  &amp;quot;Moreover, HPCL may consider a combination of share swap and cash payout, where ONGC would get additional stake in HPCL against its shareholding in MRPL,&amp;quot; the rating agency said.  ONGC-HPCL deal is unlikely to alter government subsidies for kerosene and LPG.","Business, Companies, Economy, kerosene, LPG, Oil India, ONGC","ONGC,LPG,Kerosene,Oil India,business,companies,economy",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/govt-may-ask-oilcos-to-share-lpg-kerosene-subsidy-burden-india-ratingsresearch_10405141.html

Sources said ICICI Bank has extended one-year loan to ONGC to fund the acquisition of government's 51.11 percent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL).  ONGC had yesterday stated that it has entered into loan agreements with Punjab National Bank, Bank of India and Axis Bank Ltd for the borrowing Rs 18,060 crore for the acquisition.  The pact with PNB is for loan of up to Rs 10,600 crore and with Bank of India for another Rs 4,460 crore.  With Axis Bank it has secured Rs 3,000 crore credit.  The company is likely to sign-up more loan agreements to pay Rs 36,915 crore to the government before the month-end.  The acquisition would create India's first integrated oil company. This would be ONGC's biggest acquisition and second buyout this fiscal after its Rs 7,738 crore acquisition of 80 percent stake in Gujarat State Petroleum Corp's KG basin gas block.

Top sources with direct knowledge of the issue said the government gave ONGC nod to sell its shareholding in IOC and GAIL earlier this month but the company is waiting for the right price to offload the shares.  For the moment ONGC is funding the Rs 36,915 crore acquisition of government's 51.11 per cent stake in oil refining and marketing firm Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) from the about Rs 12,000 crore cash it has and short- term borrowing.

It plans to pre-pay the one-year tenure loan it is taking for HPCL buy by selling IOC and GAIL shares in due course, they said.  Sources said ONGC had held talks with Life Insurance Corp of India (LIC) for selling IOC and GAIL shares but the state- owned insurer insisted on buying them at 10 per cent discount to the prevailing price.

Sources said while the government was seeking as much as Rs 69,000 crore for selling controlling stake in HPCL, EY had put HPCL's valuation at Rs 475 a share plus a premium for getting the controlling stake. The outside advice the company took from Citi put the price at Rs 500 per share.  The stake sale will help the government cross its sell- off target for the first time and would help stick to the fiscal deficit target of 3.2 per cent of GDP.  The government had set a target of Rs 72,500 crore from disinvestment proceeds this fiscal. Before the ONGC-HPCL deal, it had collected Rs 54,337.60 crore.

India wants to build bigger oil companies to better compete with global energy giants and withstand oil price volatility through integration of state-run oil firms.  &amp;quot;There is scope for more vertical integration in the sector,&amp;quot; oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan told a news conference.  He was speaking after Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) announced on Saturday that it was buying the government's 51.1 percent stake in HPCL to create India's first integrated oil and gas company.  Analysts have said that an integrated oil company would give Indian state-owned firms a bigger balance sheet to compete globally for assets.  Last year state-run refiners Indian Oil Corp Ltd and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd separately expressed interest in buying the government's stakes in explorer Oil India Ltd and gas utility GAIL India Ltd.  ONGC's purchase of a majority stake in HPCL is expected to close by the end of this month and Pradhan said there was a possibility to combine HPCL with ONGC's petrochemical projects and its refining arm Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd.  MRPL operates a 300,000 bpd refinery in the southern state of Karnataka.  After the deal, ONGC will control around 17 percent of India's 5 million bpd or so refining capacity.  HPCL Chairman M. K. Surana said on Monday that there could be a merger between his firm and MRPL to achieve synergy benefits in the refining and petrochemicals sectors, although he noted no discussions had yet taken place.","Business, Companies, HPCL, India, oil companies, ONGC","India,oil companies,ONGC,business,companies,HPCL",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/india-sees-scope-for-more-integration-among-state-energy-companies_10390301.html

Recently, there have been talks of a near 45-percent premium valuation for the deal estimated at&nbsp;worth over Rs 30,000 crore.

Background  The deal in talking is for the government&rsquo;s 51 percent stake in HPCL which was proposed for sale under the divestment target. A purchase by ONGC provides the government an opportunity to offload the stake without huge dilution to controlling power as the government holds a majority stake in ONGC too. The current market valuation of a 51 percent stake in HPCL stands at roughly Rs 32,000 crore, that too at a time when markets are at an all-time high.  Synergies in the deal  On the face of it, the deal is merely transactional as both companies are already under the majority government holding. With a vertical integration in the value chain between an oil explorer and an oil marketer, the deal provides an opportunity to HPCL for backward integration which would help in sourcing stable crude for its refineries in the current time of rising oil prices and help in protecting margins. For ONGC, it will enable integration with a major OMC (oil marketing company) and provide access to end markets for its products. It will also help them in bidding together for bigger global oil fields which are often outside their reach bringing in economies of scale.  The government side  Amid uncertainty on tax collections post GST and mounting expectations of a fiscal slippage, the deal is single- handedly expected to bring over Rs 30,000 crore to the treasury (without considering the valuation premium). Divestments have so far this year garnered Rs 53,800 crore, translating to a 25 percent shortfall to the targeted Rs 72,500 crore. This deal could help the government bridge the gap.      Deal Valuations  At current market price of Rs 415 the valuation of a 51 percent stake which the government holds in HPCL stands at around Rs 32,000 crore. However, recent estimates&nbsp;indicate a value of Rs 45,000 crore, which is a 45 percent premium over the market. This kind of premium seems heady, more so because the markets are already at an all-time high.  HPCL is currently trading at a 2019E (estimated) PE (price to earnings) of 10.2x and an EV/EBITDA of 7.6x which is much in line with peers. At Rs 45,000 crore, the current valuations of HPCL reflect a price of Rs 577 and a forward PE of 14.5s. This valuation falls close to that of larger international integrated oil companies. However, considering HPCL&rsquo;s margins are almost half of GRMs (gross refining margins) of international peers, such a valuation for HPCL seems expensive. Moreover, with existing debt on books the EV/EBITDA for HPCL is ahead of that of global peers and a premium valuation would push it further up.    For ONGC, sealing the deal&nbsp;at a valuation of Rs 45,000 crore brings additional pressure in terms of sourcing the funds. ONGC currently has around Rs 13,000 crore cash on the books and assuming the rest has to be raised through debt, the deal would sharply inflate the interest cost burden. If not, ONGC might have to resort to funding the deal by offloading stake in Indian Oil Corporation.  Overall, the deal especially at a premium valuation would noticeably alter the debt-to-equity profile for ONGC and repress future growth. The significant capex planned for HPCL will also call for&nbsp;additional&nbsp;funding, adding to the burden on balance sheet, thereby defeating the short-term synergies.

2018-01-10T14:53:34+05:30,ONGC,PTI,ONGC to open India's 8th sedimentary basin with Kutch gas find,Kutch would be India's eighth sedimentary basin. ONGC had previously opened for commercial production six out of India's seven producing basins. Cauvery was the last Category-I producing basin which was discovered in 1985.,"After a gap of over three- decades, state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is set to open a new sedimentary basin in the country as it puts Kutch offshore on the oil and gas map of India.  Kutch would be India's eighth sedimentary basin. ONGC had previously opened for commercial production six out of India's seven producing basins. Cauvery was the last Category-I producing basin which was discovered in 1985.  ONGC has made a significant natural gas discovery in the Gulf of Kutch off the west coast, which it plans to bring to production in 2-3 years, senior company officials said.  India has 26 sedimentary basins, of which only seven have commercial production of oil and gas. Except for the Assam shelf, ONGC opened up for commercial production all the other six basins, including Cambay, Mumbai Offshore, Rajasthan, Krishna Godavari, Cauvery and Assam-Arakan Fold Belt.  The discovery in Kutch offshore may hold about 1 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves.  The spread of Kutch offshore basin covers an area of 28000 square kilometres in water depth of up to 200 meters and will become eighth producing basin of the country.  Talking about the possibility of adding new basin for production, ONGC Director (Exploration) A K Dwivedi said: &amp;quot;The results are very encouraging and I am sure that this is going to open up many new opportunities&amp;quot;.  He said several state-of-the-art technologies like broadband seismic acquisition have been used in exploration campaign to acquire more accurate data from the exploration acreages.  While congratulating the exploration Team, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker said, &amp;quot;Our constant efforts will be on looking for new opportunities to replenish our reserves. Our focus is to improve the quality of pre- drilling data through the use of innovative technologies in order to improve the success rate.&amp;quot;  Exploration, he said, is the most important value creator for any E&amp;amp;amp;P company worldwide.  &amp;quot;ONGC will leave no stone unturned to improve success rate from its exploratory campaigns. We are trying to optimize cost as much as possible, both during pre and post exploratory drilling phases,&amp;quot; he said.  However, imbibing most modern technologies as well as conducting a customized training programme for the geoscientists to substantially enhance the quality of data before exploratory drilling starts are needed, he said. &amp;quot;This will have a huge positive impact both in short and long run.&amp;quot;  In order to go for early monetising of Kutch Offshore, ONGC is looking for pricing support from the Government of India. Since Kutch Offshore is a difficult field, its cost of production is also going to be high. Hence, a matching pricing support is extremely important.  Officials said the present government-mandated gas price of USD 2.89 per million British thermal unit does not make the discovery commercially viable. Since the find is in shallow waters, it does not qualify to get the USD 6.30 per mmBtu cap price set for difficult fields.  ONGC, they said, has stepped up the acquisition of 2D and 3D seismic data in a bid to raise production and help cut country's dependence on imports to meet oil needs by 10 per cent by 2022.  In 2017, the company acquired around 7000 square kilometre of 3D seismic data.  Officials said 37 discoveries have been made in last two years. 17 of these are onland, 18 in shallow water and two are deepsea discoveries.  Also, a framework for monetisation of 166 new and small discoveries have been mapped at the Basin and Asset level, they added.","Business, Companies, kutch gas, ONGC","ONGC,kutch gas,business,companies",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-to-open-india39s-8th-sedimentary-basinkutch-gas-find_10333401.html

Financial Express&nbsp;reports that&nbsp;ONGC may have to&nbsp;pay the government approximately Rs 45,000 crore for taking controlling stake in the latter firm that is Rs 14,500 crore more than the estimated Rs 31,000-31,500 crore at the present valuation and a 45 percent premium over its current market capitalisation.  The deal received the government&rsquo;s nod in July of last year after the Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his Budget 2017 speech announced its plan to create an oil behemoth that will compete with international and domestic private oil companies.  It has been reported in some publication that oil ministry has raised concerns over the valuation of the deal and wanted to wait for a while to allow ONGC to raise enough funds.  The oil explorer has internally valued HPCL at a higher valuation than the current market price and is likely to pay the government through a mix of internal resources and debt raised through bonds.

Revenues declined 7.8% QoQ at Rs 24492.6 crore on account of lower realisations as well as sales volume QoQ. oil &amp;amp;amp; gas production was marginally below our estimates. As per expectations, the quarter saw nil subsidy burden and net realisations were at US$60.3/bbl due to a decline in crude oil prices. Subsequently, EBITDA during the quarter declined 12.1% QoQ and came in at Rs 13290 crore. However, reported PAT increased 6.1% QoQ to Rs 6263.1 crore (our estimate: Rs 5925.7 crore) on account of higher other income. Outlook The movement in oil prices and subsidy sharing are important for ONGC's performance, going ahead. We model oil prices of US$ 60/bbl for the rest of FY20E and FY21E, given the current oil market scenario. However, due to lower growth on a sustainable basis, in spite of lower valuation, we have a HOLD rating with a target price of Rs 130/share.

2019-11-22T12:30:42+05:30,ONGC,Moneycontrol News,ONGC's depleting cash reserves hit exploration spends: Report &nbsp;,This decline in exploratory expenditure comes alongside a steady decline in domestic crude oil production. ,"Oil and Natural Gas Corporation's cash and bank balances tanked to Rs 504 crore in March 2019 &ndash; according to a report in The Indian Express.  In March 2018, cash and bank balances stood at Rs 1,013 crore while a year earlier it was Rs 9,511 crore.  The freefall in the upstream petroleum major's cash reserves is particularly concerning as it is India's largest oil explorer &ndash; accounting for 60 percent of the country&rsquo;s crude oil production.  While the slide is precipitated by two deals involving ONGC's stake buys in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd and GSPC, the government has maintained that the company has &amp;quot;sufficient lines of credit from banks and strong access to capital markets&amp;quot; to maintain its working capital requirements.  However, comparative six years data shows ONGC's oil exploration spend steadily decreased by half from Rs 11,687 crore in March 2014 to Rs 6,016 crore in March 2019. The corollary is a steady decrease in domestic crude production, which slipped to 35.68 MMT in FY18 from 38.09 MMT in FY12, it noted.  Additionally, since ONGC lists its exploration and production business as the &ldquo;predominant cash-generator&rdquo;, the slip is viewed as negative.  A silver lining here is the company&rsquo;s developmental wells spend, which kept pace over the past six years, up to Rs 9,362 crore in FY19 from Rs 8,518 crore in FY14.","Business, capex, Companies, India, ONGC","ONGC,cash reserves,O&amp;amp;G sector,HPCL,GSPC,Capex,expenditure,PSU,Dharmendra Pradhan,crude, output,GAIL,IOC,production,oil fields,Business,Companies,India,Oil,government,finances",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc39s-depleting-cash-reserves-hit-exploration-spends-report-Â _13206361.html

The outlook on the rating is negative, Moody's said in a statement.  &amp;quot;The notes' rating is in line with ONGC's Baa1 issuer rating, which is in turn primarily driven by its standalone credit profile as captured by the company's baa1 Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA),&amp;quot; says Vikas Halan, a Moody's Senior Vice President.  The rating reflects ONGC's position as the largest integrated oil and gas company in India with significant reserves, production and crude distillation capacity as also its substantial operating cash flow generation capacity.  It also factors the firm's solid credit metrics that have improved but remain constrained by volatile &mdash; although range-bound &mdash; oil prices and high shareholder returns.  At the same time, Moody's expected that ONGC will not be asked to share fuel subsidies, as long as oil prices stay below USD 70 per barrel.  &amp;quot;ONGC's issuer rating also incorporates the company's high likelihood of extraordinary support from and very high dependence on the Government of India, in times of need. However, this assumption of government support has not resulted in any rating uplift, as the sovereign's rating is below ONGC's BCA,&amp;quot; it said.  Given ONGC's strong credit metrics and status as a government-owned company, it enjoys strong access to debt capital markets and has substantial financial flexibility through equity stakes in Indian Oil Corp and GAIL India, which together were valued at about Rs 21,000 crore as on November 14, 2019.  Moody's ratings for ONGC are based on the full consolidation of Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) which includes the full consolidation of HPCL's 49 per cent-owned joint venture, HPCL-Mittal Energy.  The government owns 62.98 per cent of ONGC's equity and has the ability to appoint all of its board of directors.  &amp;quot;The negative outlook on ONGC is in line with the negative outlook on the Government of India's rating and reflects Moody's view that ONGC's ratings will be downgraded if India's sovereign rating is downgraded to Baa3 from Baa2,&amp;quot; Moody's said.  &amp;quot;Given the negative outlook, an upgrade is unlikely. The outlook will return to stable if the outlook on the sovereign rating moves to stable.&amp;quot;  ONGC's ratings may experience downward pressure if the sovereign rating is downgraded, ONGC increases its pace of acquisitions such that it results in higher business risk and a deterioration in its credit metrics, or oil prices decline on a sustained basis resulting in weak cash flow generation and a deterioration in ONGC's credit metrics, it added.","BCA, Business, Companies, Moody's Baa1, ONGC","business,companies,Moody's Baa1,ONGC,BCA",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moody39s-assigns-baa1-rating-to-ongc39s-proposed-senior-unsecured-notes_13197981.html

2019-10-14T14:25:05+05:30,ONGC,Reuters,ONGC free to sell stake in HPCL: Dharmendra Pradhan,"In its most expensive acquisition ever, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) last year paid Rs 36,915 crore to buy government's entire 51.11 per cent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL).","Amid reports of ONGC's inability to derive any benefit out of its HPCL acquisition, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Monday said the state-owned firm was free to sell its stake in the oil refining and marketing company.  In its most expensive acquisition ever, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) last year paid Rs 36,915 crore to buy government's entire 51.11 per cent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL).  Despite being the majority stakeholder in the company, ONGC has only got one member on the board and virtually no say in the management.  HPCL didnt even recognise ONGC as its promoter for almost one-and-half-years before a Securities and Exchange Board of India rap forced it to list its majority owner as a promoter.  Since acquiring the stake, ONGC has only been able to appoint one director to that firm's board.  HPCL head Mukesh K Surana continues with the title of Chairman and Managing Director despite corporate governance structure mandate of only one chairman in a group and subsidiaries being headed by managing directors or chief executive officers (CEOs).  When asked if the government had given ONGC nod to sell stake in HPCL, Pradhan told reporters that &amp;quot;These are market decisions. They are autonomous companies. They are free to take their own decision at appropriate time.&amp;quot;  ONGC had hoped that the addition of an oil refining and marketing company would make it a vertically integrated oil and gas company when it had acquired government stake in HPCL in January last year.  However, no tangible synergies have flowed to the company. The acquisition turned ONGC from a zero-debt company to a firm with no cash and a huge debt pile.  Sources said, since the government had repealed the acts that nationalised HPCL and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL), ONGC is now free to sell the stake.  The board of ONGC has on at least one occasion debated on the logic of retaining the stake in HPCL when no synergies were flowing, they said.  HPCL by virtue of being 51.11 per cent owned by a state-owned firm had continued to be classified as a public sector undertaking. But with the act that promised its nationalised PSU character no longer there, it can be sold in parts or full to a strategic investor, they said.  The government had in 2016 repealed the legislations that had nationalised HPCL and BPCL. The Repealing and Amending Act of 2016 had annulled &amp;quot;187 obsolete and redundant laws lying unnecessarily on the statue-book&amp;quot; including the Act of 1970s that had nationalised HPCL and BPCL.  HPCL was incorporated in 1974 after the takeover and merger of erstwhile Esso Standard and Lube India through the Esso (Acquisition of Undertaking in India) Act passed by Parliament.  The Supreme Court had in September 2003 ruled that BPCL and HPCL can be privatised only after Parliament amends a law it had previously passed to nationalise the two firms.  Besides others, the 2016 legislation approved by the Parliament listed repealing in &amp;quot;the whole&amp;quot; The Esso (Acquisition of Undertakings in India) Act, 1974, The Burmah Shell (Acquisition of Undertakings Act, 1976 and The Caltex [Acquisition of Shares of Caltex Oil The whole] Refining (India) Ltd and of the Undertakings in India of Caltex (India) Ltd] Act, 1977.  The Supreme Court had in September 2003 cited the Esso (Acquisition of Undertaking in India) Act and the Burmah Shell (Acquisition of Undertaking in India) Act, 1976 and Caltex (Acquisition of Shares of Caltex Oil Refining India Ltd and all the Undertakings in India for Caltex India Ltd) Act, 1977 to rule that the government cannot privatise HPCL and BPCL without approaching Parliament for changing the Nationalisation Act.","Business, Companies, Dharmendra Pradhan, Economy, HPCL, ONGC","economy,business,companies,ONGC,HPCL,Dharmendra pradhan",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-free-to-sell-stakehpcl-dharmendra-pradhan_13071261.html
2019-10-13T11:08:04+05:30,ONGC,PTI,PM Modi to skip oil CEO meet over scheduling issues,"The meets, held under the aegis of Niti Aayog, have been a sounding board for the government to reorient policies to attract the illusive investment in finding new oil and gas reserves","Prime Minister Narendra Modi is believed to have cancelled a brainstorming meeting with global oil and gas experts and CEOs, which was slated for October 14, over scheduling issues, sources said.  The fourth annual meeting that coincides with the CERAWeek - the world's premier energy event - was scheduled for&nbsp;October 14 afternoon but was cancelled due to the Prime Minister's engagements, they said.  The meets, held under the aegis of Niti Aayog, have been a sounding board for the government to reorient policies to attract the illusive investment in finding new oil and gas reserves and bringing them to production so as to cut India's oil import dependence.  French energy giant Total SA's Chairman and CEO Patrick Pouyanne and UK's BP plc Group Chief Executive Bob Dudley were among the leaders who were scheduled to attend the meeting with the Prime Minister on October 14.  The meeting and other such feedback mechanism had led to the government doing course corrections on some of its policies, particularly the exploration licensing policy and natural gas pricing rules.  The government had, going against the industry advise, brought in a revenue sharing model for allotting oil and gas acreage.  Under the 2016 policy, bidders offering highest share of oil and gas to government were allotted the blocks but the regime failed to attract big names to exploration scene as companies preferred risks to be covered.  Two years later, the government reversed it and went back to allocating blocks to companies that offered largest exploration programme with a guarantee of first recovering all such cost from oil and gas found.  Similarly, the 2014 policy of pricing natural gas at rates prevalent in gas exporting countries failed to enthuse any new investments, prompting it to bring in a new rate for fields in difficult areas such as deep sea.  At the last edition of the brainstorming on October 15, 2018, &amp;quot;subjects such as expansion of oil and gas infrastructure in India; enhancing exploration and production; potential in solar energy and biofuels; and the Union Government's holistic approach to the energy sector came up for discussion,&amp;quot; according to an official statement issued on that day.  Modi's first meeting was on January 5, 2016, where suggestions for reforming natural gas prices were made. More than a year later, the government allowed higher natural gas price for the yet-to-be-produced fields in difficult areas like deep sea.  In the second edition in October 2017, suggestions were made for giving out equity to foreign and private companies in producing oil and gas fields of state-owned ONGC and OIL.  Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India&nbsp;(OIL) this year offered dozens of small discovered field for bidding by foreign and private firms.  The meetings, coordinated by the Niti Aayog, focus on challenges posed by volatile oil prices, impacted by changing geopolitical situation.  The meetings look at measures to attract investments and steps for making it easier to do business in India.  The government is looking at private investment to raise domestic oil and gas production, which has stagnated for the last few years while fuel demand has been rising by 5-6 per cent annually. India is dependent on imports to meet 83 per cent of its demand, and more than half of its natural gas requirements.  The Prime Minister in 2015 had set a target of reducing India's oil dependence by 10 percent to 67 percent (based on import dependence of 77 percent in 2014-15) by 2022.  Import dependence has only increased since then and the government is now looking for ways to raise domestic output.  Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo and India's Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan were also scheduled to attend the Monday meeting, they said.  Also slated to attend the meeting were ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) Chairman Sanjiv Singh, GAIL India head Ashutosh Karnatak, Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) Chairman Mukesh Kumar Suran, and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) Chairman D Rajkumar.","Business, Narendra Modi","modi,narendra modi,pm modi,ceraweek,niti aayog,total, bp,british petroleum",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/pm-modi-to-skip-oil-ceo-meet-over-scheduling-issues_13068361.html

","India's top oil and gas producer ONGC on August 30 unveiled a $15-16 billion investment plan to double output from its domestic and overseas fields, expand its refining capacity three folds and diversify into renewables to earn four times higher net profit by 2040.  Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), which has seen crude oil production stagnate as a majority of its prime fields are ageing and are past their prime, has adopted a new 'Energy Strategy 2040', company Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker told reporters here.  The company, which started with an equity infusion of Rs 343 crore by the government more than six decades back, has generated a wealth of over Rs 9 lakh crore since then and is now venturing on a new road to further enhance value.  It has already seen a turnaround in natural gas with output rising for the fourth successive year to 24.75 billion cubic meters and is further slated to go up to 32 bcm by FY24, he said. &amp;quot;We see gas production rising to 40 bcm by 2040,&amp;quot; he said.  The new Energy Strategy 2040, which was adopted by the board a few weeks back, sets target of &amp;quot;three-time revenue distributed across exploration and production (E&amp;amp;amp;P), refining and marketing; 4 times current PAT with 10 per cent contribution from non-oil and gas business; and 5-6 times current market capitalisation,&amp;quot; he said.  ONGC, he said, will still remain strongly invested in oil and gas but it also looks beyond hydrocarbons.  &amp;quot;The new strategy document aims to transform ONGC in a new 'avatar' in this new energy landscape as a diversified energy company with a strong contribution from non-E&amp;amp;amp;P businesses,&amp;quot; he said.  The firm produced 24.23 million tonnes of crude oil in the 2018-19 fiscal year and 25.81 billion cubic metres of natural gas from its domestic fields. Another 10.1 million tonnes of oil and 4.736 bcm of gas was produced from its overseas assets.  It had a turnover of Rs 1,09,654 crore and a net profit of Rs 26,715 crore in the year ended March 31, 2019. It has a market capitalisation of Rs 1.55 lakh crore as on date.  &amp;quot;Our fields are old and ageing, 30-50 years old and have reached a plateau. So we are investing in re-development projects to arrest the fall and extend the life,&amp;quot; he said.  The company is investing around Rs 86,000 crore in 27 major projects to boost oil and gas production, which has stagnated over the last few years.  These projects will yield 76 million tonnes of oil and 121 bcm of gas.  The overall plan, which includes overseas projects, expanding refining capacity and investing in renewables, will entail $15-16 billion investment.  &amp;quot;These numbers will change as we progress with some projects being advanced and finances undergoing changes,&amp;quot; ONGC Director (Finance) Subhash Kumar said.  Shanker said its investments in new frontiers - primarily to hedge against disruption in existing portfolio, will include carbon capture and storage, artificial intelligence for exploration, hydrogen fuel, lithium mining and biofuels.  Oil and oil equivalent natural gas production is seen rising from 65 million tonnes to 135 million tonnes by 2040, he said.  &amp;quot;The strategic roadmap envisions a future-ready organization whose growth is predicated on a few important planks: consolidation of our core upstream business (domestic and international); expansion into value accreting adjacencies in the oil and gas value chain (downstream and petrochemicals) and diversification into renewables (offshore wind) and select new frontier plays through dedicated venture fund,&amp;quot; he said.  ?It targets cumulative upstream output (local and overseas) almost doubling from current levels with 2 per cent and 5 per cent CAGR in domestic and international operations respectively.  With two 35 million tonnes per annum of oil refining capacity vested in its two subsidiaries -- HPCL andPL, ONGC is targeting to raise this capacity to around 90-100 million tonnes. Also, expansion is petrochemicals will be prioritised.  Besides, ONGC plans to make investments in renewables energy sources with a target to create 5-10 gigawatts portfolio with a focus on offshore wind power, he said.  ONGC has been under pressure to reverse the falling output from its ageing fields, where the natural decline has set in. It is investing heavily to arrest the domestic fall while at the same time aggressively look for assets overseas.  &amp;quot;The strategic roadmap also looks to create long-term optionality through investor play (venture fund corpus of about $1 billion) in select frontier themes such as clean energy, artificial intelligence (AI) or reservoir/field services technology,&amp;quot; he said.  In upstream oil and gas exploration and production (E&amp;amp;amp;P), priority would be accorded to select difficult plays (high-pressure high temperature, ultra-deepwater) with high-prospectivity and low stretch from current core, development of in-house enhanced oil recovery solutions to maximize legacy production, exploration-focused technology partnerships, dedicated marginal fields unit as well as building decommissioning capabilities.  He said there was significant room for deriving operational synergies between HPCL andPL through integrated crude sourcing, centralised trading, capability and infrastructure sharing.

2019-07-16T17:33:05+05:30,ONGC,PTI,Moody's affirms Baa1 rating to ONGC,"ONGC's Baa1 issuer ratings are primarily driven by its standalone credit profile, as captured in its baa1 Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA).  ","Moody's Investors Service&nbsp;July 17 affirmed state-owned ONGC's Baa1 local and foreign currency issuer ratings, saying it reflect an improvement in the firm's credit metrics because of rise in oil prices.  Oil and Natural Gas Corporation's (ONGC) consolidated credit metrics - as measured by retained cash flow (RCF) to net debt - improved to 51 per cent for the fiscal ended March 31, 2019 (fiscal 2019) as compared to 40 per cent for fiscal 2018. &amp;quot;The improvement was largely driven by better earnings, which in turn was because of higher realized crude oil prices,&amp;quot; Moody's said in a statement.  This should result in ONGC generating positive free cash flow - despite the company's high level of capital spending and shareholder returns - which Moody's expects the company will use to reduce its borrowings. Its credit metrics will likely remain appropriate for its rating category over the next 12-18 months.  &amp;quot;The rating affirmation reflects our expectation that ONGC's credit metrics, which have improved over the last 12 months because of the high net realized oil price, will remain appropriate for its ratings,&amp;quot; said Vikas Halan, a Moody's Senior Vice President. &amp;quot;Based on an average net realized oil price assumption of USD 65 per barrel, we expect that the company's earnings for fiscal 2020 will be broadly in line with fiscal 2019.&amp;quot;  ONGC's Baa1 issuer ratings are primarily driven by its standalone credit profile, as captured in its baa1 Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA).  The company's BCA reflects in turn its position as the largest integrated oil and gas company in India with significant reserves, production and crude distillation capacity; substantial operating cash flow generation capacity; and credit metrics that have improved but will remain constrained by volatile - although range-bound - oil prices and high shareholder returns, it said.  &amp;quot;At the same time, the BCA incorporates Moody's expectation that the company will not be asked to share fuel subsidies, as long as oil prices stay below USD 70 per barrel,&amp;quot; Moody's said.  ONGC's rating also incorporates a high likelihood of extraordinary support from and very high dependence on the government.  However, this assumption does not result in any rating uplift, because the sovereign rating is below ONGC's BCA.  ONGC generates sufficient cash flow to fund its capital spending and shareholder returns. However, the company's cash and cash equivalents of Rs 10,20 crore as of March 31, 2019, are insufficient to cover its debt maturing over the next 12 months of Rs 54,500 crore. Of this, about Rs 25,500 crore represents working capital loans and scheduled debt maturities at its subsidiaries - HPCL and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemical Ltd - and are not guaranteed by ONGC.  Of the remaining Rs 29,000 crore, ONGC has already repaid or refinanced about Rs 10,000 crore as of July 15, 2019.  &amp;quot;Given ONGC's strong credit metrics and status as a government-owned company, it maintains strong access to debt funding markets and can refinance its remaining short-term borrowings,&amp;quot; Moody's said.  Also, the company maintains substantial financial flexibility, as seen by its stakes in Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Gail (India) Ltd (Baa2 stable), which were valued at about Rs 22,600 crore at July 15.  The government owns a 64.25 per cent direct stake in ONGC and appoints all the directors on the company's board.  Moreover, the risk from government influence was evident in January 2018, when the government sold its 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL to ONGC for Rs 36,900 crore, which resulted in the weakening of ONGC's credit metrics.  &amp;quot;Because of this risk, ONGC's ratings are constrained to no more than one notch above the sovereign's Baa2 rating,&amp;quot; Moody's said, adding the rating outlook is stable on the expectation that shareholder returns and the company's growth plans will continue to be executed within the tolerance level of its current ratings.  In addition, the stable outlook assumes the company will improve its debt maturity profile, such that its cash and cash equivalents, along with committed bank facilities, can cover debt maturing over the next 12 months.  &amp;quot;A rating upgrade to A3 will require ONGC to improve its liquidity profile, maintain strong credit metrics, and also for Moody's to upgrade India's sovereign rating to at least Baa1,&amp;quot; the statement said.  ONGC's ratings could experience downward pressure if Moody's downgrades the sovereign's rating or the oil prices decline or the company increases its pace of acquisitions such that it faces higher business risk and a deterioration in its credit metrics.","Business, Moody's Investors' Service, ONGC","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, ONGC,Moody's Investors Service,Moody's affirm Baa1 rating to ONGC",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/moody39s-affirms-baa1-rating-to-ongc_12756781.html

","State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has discovered over 230 million tonnes of in-place oil reserves in the last three years, Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said July 1.  In a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha, he said India's top oil and gas producer ONGC as on April 1, 2019, has in place oil reserves of 459.84 million tonnes.  These reserves are spread over 16 assets it currently extracts oil from, he said.  &amp;quot;ONGC has established 230.29 million tones of oil initial-in-place during the last three years,&amp;quot; he added.  The company produced 21.11 million tonnes of oil in the fiscal year ended March 31 (2018-19). In last three years, it produced a cumulative 65.66 million tonnes of oil.  To a separate question, Pradhan said the government had constituted a committee for preparing a road map to reduce the dependency on energy imports by 10 per cent by 2021-22.  India, currently, is more than 83 per cent dependent on imports to meet its oil needs and roughly imports half of its natural gas requirement.  The panel suggested &amp;quot;five-pronged strategy broadly comprises of increasing domestic production of oil and gas, promoting energy efficiency and conservation measures, giving thrust on demand substitution, capitalizing untapped potential in bio-fuels and other alternate fuels/renewables and implementing measures for refinery process improvements,&amp;quot; he said.  The government, he said, has taken several steps to enhance exploration and production of oil and gas in the country. These include a policy of extension of contracts for existing fields, policy for relaxations, discovered small field policy, Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP), policy for early monetization of coal bed methane (CBM), setting up of National Data Repository and appraisal of unexplored areas in sedimentary basins.  &amp;quot;The government in February 2019 approved major reforms in exploration and licensing policy to enhance exploration activities, attract domestic and foreign investment in unexplored/unallocated areas of sedimentary basins and accelerate domestic production of oil and gas from existing fields,&amp;quot; he said.  He did not elaborate.  The policy reforms provide greater weightage to exploration work in bidding out of areas on simplified fiscal and contractual terms, he said, adding exploration blocks in areas that do not have any established hydrocarbon potential will not have any production or revenue sharing with government.  Also, early monetization of discoveries is being targeted by extending fiscal incentives and natural gas production incentivized through marketing and pricing freedom. Functional freedom has been given to national oil companies for collaboration, and private sector participation for production enhancement methods in nomination fields, he said.  Pradhan said the government is also promoting the use of environment-friendly CNG as a transportation fuel. Also, ethanol is being blended in petrol and non-edible oil in diesel to cut imports.  India spent Rs 7.83 lakh crore on crude oil imports in 2018-19, up from Rs 5.66 lakh crore in the previous year. The money spent on crude oil imports was highest since 2013-14 when the import bill was Rs 8.64 lakh crore, he said.","Business, Dharmendra Pradhan, India, Oil and Natural Gas Corp","ONGC,Oil and Natural Gas Corp,Dharmendra Pradhan,Lok Sabha",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-discovers-230-mn-tonnesoil-reserves-dharmendra-pradhan_12702061.html

As per expectations, the quarter saw nil subsidy burden while net realisations were at US$61.9/bbl (marginally above our estimate). Revenues came in above our estimates at Rs 26758.5 crore despite lower own oil production as JV sales volume and revenues were above estimates. EBITDA during the quarter came in at Rs 14387.4 crore, below our estimate of Rs 13337.7 crore mainly on account of higher than estimated other expenses. PAT was at Rs 4044.6 crore (our estimate of Rs 5791.4 crore). Outlook The movement in oil prices and subsidy sharing will decide ONGC&rsquo;s performance, going ahead. We assume nil subsidy burden due to decline in oil prices and the new government. We model oil prices of US$65/bbl for FY20E and FY21E, given the current oil market scenario.

Sources said the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) has completed the evaluation of the bids received for 32 oil and gas exploration blocks that were auctioned in the latest licensing round.  As per the bid evaluation, ONGC and Vedanta Ltd are top bidders in nine blocks each and state-owned Oil India Ltd (OIL) in 12 areas. Reliance-BP combine outbid ONGC in one Krishna Godavari basin block in the Bay of Bengal.  The winners of the auction will be announced after the approval of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, sources added.  Bidding for 14 blocks on offer in the Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) round-II and another 18 oil and gas blocks and 5 coal-bed methane (CBM) blocks on offer in OALP-III closed on May 15.  Reliance-BP had made their first bid in eight years when they sought an area that previously was held by ONGC, sources said.  When the government in July 2017 allowed companies to carve out blocks of their choice with a view to bring about 2.8 million sq km of unexplored area in the country under exploration, Reliance-BP sought the KG area containing the discoveries.  Under the new policy, areas sought by any company are put on auction with the initiator or the company that originally carved out the block, getting a 5 point advantage.  Sources said Reliance-BP managed to get the coveted KG block in the latest auction by a small margin that possibly came from the originator marks and a commitment to do a shale core exploration.  Reliance-BP had last jointly bid for a KG deep water block in the 8th bid round under previous licensing policy in 2008. They, however, gave up the block after not finding any commercially exploitable oil and gas reserves.  In the following year, Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance on its own bid for six blocks in the ninth round of New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) but did not win any block.  Sources said at the close of bidding for the current round on May 15, ONGC had put in bids for 20 out of the 32 blocks on offer, while OIL made bids for 16 blocks.  Vedanta, which had walked away with 41 out of the 55 blocks offered in OALP-I last year, bid for 30 areas.  Indian Oil Corp (IOC), GAIL (India) and SunPetro bid for two blocks each, they said.  BP had more than a decade back entered the country buying 30 per cent stake in Reliance's 21 oil and gas exploration blocks for USD 7.2 billion. All but a couple of blocks have since been relinquished.  NELP has since been replaced by Hydrocarbon Exploration Licensing Policy (HELP) under which OALP bids round have been held.  Under the new policy, called open acreage licensing policy, companies are allowed to put in an expression of interest or EoI for prospecting of oil and gas in any area that is presently not under any production or exploration licence.  The EoIs can be put in at any time of the year but they are accumulated twice annually.  The blocks or areas that receive EoIs at the end of a cycle are put up for auction with the originator or the firm that originally selected the area getting a 5-mark advantage.  The two windows of accumulating EoIs end on May 15 and November 15 every year. EoIs accumulated till May 15 are supposed to be put on auction by June 30 and those in the second window by December 31.  But a delay in offering of blocks meant that OALP-II and OALP-III ran concurrently.  While the OALP-I round saw an investment commitment of about Rs 60,000 crore, the government is expecting about 90,000 crore of investment in the latest round.  In OALP-1, Vedanta walked away with 41 out of 55 blocks bid out. Oil India won nine blocks while ONGC managed to win just two.  Blocks are awarded to the company which offers the highest share of oil and gas to the government as well as commits to do maximum exploration work by way of shooting 2D and 3D seismic survey and drilling exploration wells.  The new policy replaced the old system of government carving out areas and bidding them out. It guarantees marketing and pricing freedom and moves away from production sharing model of previous rounds to a revenue-sharing model, where companies offering the maximum share of oil and gas to the government are awarded the block.

Revenue for FY19 was up 29% YoY to Rs 1,096.55bn owing to 34% jump in oil price realisation to Rs 4,766/bbl and NG realisation was up 19.1% YoY to USD3.32/mmbtu. Crude oil sales volumes were down 5% YoY to 22.5mmt and gas sales volume was up 5.1% to 20.5bcm. Outlook Upstream companies were out of flavour despite realizing market price for crude oil, mainly on account of lower provisioning of budgetary support in FY19 (Rs 248bn). The subsidy sharing concern allayed when the Govt. committed to settle Rs 430bn of subsidy from its own pocket. We do not foresee any subsidy sharing burden on upstream companies if crude oil prices remain below USD80/bbl. In the absence of overhang of subsidy sharing, upstream companies should be re-rated.

After the resounding success of CPSE ETF and Bharat-22 ETF, the government is looking at diversifying the ETF basket by including stocks public sector banks and financial institutions.  &amp;quot;We will be soon appointing advisor to suggest on launching an ETF with PSU bank scrips. The advisor will also look into the feasibility of including stocks of financial institutions and insurance companies into the basket,&amp;quot; the official told PTI.  The plan to launch a bank ETF comes on the back of the government seeing huge investor demand for two existing ETFs. It has raised Rs 32,900 crore through two tranches and an additional fund offer of Bharat-22 ETF, and Rs 38,000 crore in five tranches of CPSE ETF in the domestic market.  &amp;quot;We expect balance sheet of PSU banks to strengthen going forward and an ETF would provide risk-averse investors an option to hold shares of multiple banks through a single financial instrument,&amp;quot; the official said.  Currently, there are two state-owned insurance companies -- General Insurance Corp of India and New India Assurance Co&nbsp;-- and 19 public sector banks that are listed on exchanges. Besides, financial institution IFCI is also listed on the exchanges.  The government currently has two exchange-traded funds -- CPSE ETF and Bharat-22 ETF -- listed on domestic exchanges. ETFs function like a mutual fund scheme and have underlying assets of government-owned companies.  The Finance Ministry has also started consultations with global investors for launching CPSE-scrip based ETF in overseas market.  The official further said that the government does not intend to launch in the domestic market any new ETFs comprising stocks of public sector companies since in most of these companies government holding is nearing 51 per cent.

Consolidated net profit in April 2018 to March 2019 period at Rs 1,682 crore was 71.4 per cent higher than Rs 981 crore net profit in the previous financial year, the company said in a statement here.  OVL is the unlisted overseas arm of ONGC and is not obligated to report quarterly earning numbers.  Turnover rose 40.5 per cent to Rs 14,632 crore.  This came on back of an 8 per cent surge in crude oil production from assets the company has in foreign countries. Oil production rose to 10.1 million tonnes in 2018-19 from 9.35 million tonnes in the previous year.  Natural gas output, however, fell 1.6 per cent to 4.73 billion cubic meters.  OVL holds a stake in 41 oil and gas asset in 20 countries spanning from Brazil to New Zealand.  The company said production from South Sudan's Greater Pioneer Operating Company (GPOC) has resumed during the year after prolonged shutdown since December 2013. Presently, the block is flowing crude oil at about 35,000 barrels per day.  The firm also struck oil for the second time in a Colombian block, CPO-5. &amp;quot;The well flowed at a self-flow rate of about 4,000 barrels per day,&amp;quot; the statement said adding oil was first discovered on the block in 2017.  &amp;quot;With the two wells, current production from CPO-5 is more than 8,000 barrels per day,&amp;quot; it said.  During the year, the company and its partner in Mozambique's giant Rovuma Offshore Area 1 gas field have sold around 11 million tonnes per annum of the LNG that will be produced from the project to several global consumers and traders.  Also, the company shipped the first equity oil cargo from Lower Zakum Concession in UAE to group refinery at Mangalore.

2019-04-14T12:02:04+05:30,ONGC,PTI,"ONGC arrests fall in oil output from onshore wells, posts higher growth despite vintage fields","ONGC has in recent times faced immense pressure from the government, which has blamed it for the continuing decline in the country's output.","State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has arrested a declining crude oil production trend in its onshore fields and registered a 1.25 percent rise in output in the fiscal year ended March 2019, top company officials said.  ONGC produced 6.141 million tonnes of crude oil from its onshore fields despite majority of them being more than 50 years old and facing a natural decline.  The company has been able to make a production turnaround through a slew of initiatives, they said.  India's largest oil and gas producer has in recent times faced immense pressure from the government, which has blamed it for the continuing decline in the country's output.  ONGC raising output is critical to meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's target of cutting oil imports by 10 percent by 2022.  ONGC has already reversed years of decline in natural gas output, posting a record 6.5 percent jump in production to 25.9 billion cubic metres in 2018-19.  However, oil production from offshore fields continues to be on a decline and will only reverse next year when Krishna Godavari basin field KG-DWN-98/2 comes onstream.  Officials said ONGC has monetised five out of the total 13 discoveries during 2018-19 on a fast-track mode which helped contribute to the growth in production from onshore fields.  In order to sustain production and achieve higher onshore growth, ONGC drilled 303 wells during the last fiscal, which is the highest since 2014-15.  The company has also engaged reputed international oil and gas consulting firm Gaffney Cline &amp;amp;amp; Associates for high level review of two major fields of largest onshore producing asset, Mehsana in Gujarat and a few other onshore fields for enhancement of production.  The company has invested about Rs 5,000 crore in the last fiscal in its onshore operations on a number of projects and has a similar investment plan for the financial year 2019-20, officials said.  Talking about the performance, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker said: &amp;quot;The growth in onshore production has been achieved beating enormous challenges which cropped up due to ageing of the fields. This has come at a time when fields with similar vintage are facing a sharp decline internationally.&amp;quot;  &amp;quot;The onshore fields, which are mostly five-decade old, are faced with increased level of water-cut (the water which comes with oil during production),&amp;quot; he said, adding &amp;quot;while disposing of produced water is a critical issue, the stringent environmental laws and complex land acquisition process make the challenges in onshore quite difficult to surmount.&amp;quot;  Shanker said a well-wise focused approach and deploying state-of-the-technology for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) have started paying a rich dividend in not only arresting the decline in production trend but also to grow.  ONGC Director (Onshore) S K Moitra said the company continues to take up various initiatives on the EOR front and as many as six EOR projects have been either implemented or are on the verge of implementation.","Business, ONGC","ong,oil and natural gas corporation,ongc production",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-arrests-falloil-outputonshore-wells-posts-higher-growth-despite-vintage-fields_12373561.html

A high-level committee headed by Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar late last year considered &amp;quot;transferring&amp;quot; western offshore oil and gas fields of Mumbai High, Heera, D-1, Vasai East and Panna as well as Greater Jorajan and Geleki field in Assam, Baghewala in Rajasthan and Kalol oilfield in Gujarat to private/foreign companies.  Multiple sources in Niti Aayog and government said, the plan to give away fields producing 95 per cent of India's current oil and gas could not go through because of very strong opposition from Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) as well as some quarters within the government who found something amiss in the proposal.  Besides the 9 fields, 149 marginal fields, that contribute about 5 per cent of the domestic production, were to be clustered and bid out.  While ONGC opposed giving away on a platter to private/foreign sector what it discovered after years of toil and spending billions of dollars over last four decades, some in government were not convinced by the incremental potential toyed with to get the proposal through, they said adding it wasn't clear how the incremental output numbers were arrived at in absence of any real basin or field study by the panel.  The proposal brought before the panel, which was appointed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in October last year to boost stagnant output from aging fields of public sector oil companies, was to give private/foreign companies complete marketing and pricing freedom after getting from them an enhanced production profile for the fields.  National oil companies (NOCs) were to get 10 per cent of incremental output over business as usual (BAU) scenario, sources said.  This was a second attempt to take away some of the fields of ONGC for giving to private and foreign companies.  In October 2017, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) had identified 15 producing fields with collective reserve of 791.2 million tonne of crude oil and 333.46 billion cubic metres of gas of NOCs for handing over to private firms in the hope they would improve upon the baseline estimate and their extraction.  The plan, however, could not go through as ONGC strongly countered the DGH proposal with its own proposal that it be allowed to outsource operations on the same terms as the government plan.  Private and foreign companies have generally shied away from taking up exploration blocks and have instead been lobbying for getting a stake in producing oil and gas fields of ONGC and Oil India Ltd (OIL) saying they can raise output by bringing in capital and technology.  NOCs, on the other hand, contend that they do not have pricing and marketing freedom and they too can get the technology given the same is provided.  The final report that the Rajiv Kumar-led committee submitted on January 29, had watered down the proposal by recommending freedom to NOCs to choose field specific implementation model including farm out, joint venture or technical service model for raising output from the fields that contribute 95 per cent of the current output.  Pricing and marketing freedom for any new field development plan that they bring was also recommended.  Sources said, 64 small and marginal fields of ONGC and two of OIL were recommended to be bid out within four months and NOCs allowed to retain 54 others (49 by ONGC and 3 by OIL) where enhanced oil recovery/improved oil recovery schemes were under implementation.  The recommendations have been accepted by the government.  The overhauled policy notified by the government provides for complete marketing and pricing freedom for oil and gas produced from areas bid out in future bid rounds.  Oil and gas acreage or blocks in all future bid rounds will be awarded primarily on the basis of exploration work commitment, it said adding companies will not have to share any profit with the government on oil and gas produced from less explored areas.","Business, India, Market news, Mumbai High, NITI Aayog, ONGC","Oil and Natural Gas Corp,ONGC,Mumbai High,Niti Aayog, Rajiv Kumar",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc39s-mumbai-high-vasai-east-came-close-to-being-sold-stopped-after-opposition_12253281.html

2019-03-07T17:47:04+05:30,ONGC,PTI,ONGC wins back Chinnewala Tibba gas field; contracts signed for 23 oil &amp;amp; gas fields under DSF-II,ONGC won back five out of the 23 discovered oil and gas fields that the government took away from the state-owned firm and Oil India Ltd (OIL) for auctioning in the second round of discovered small field (DSF).  ,"State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) Thursday signed a contract for the prolific Chinnewala Tibba gas field in Rajasthan, which it had discovered around 15 years ago but was taken away and auctioned by the government.  ONGC won back five out of the 23 discovered oil and gas fields that the government took away from the state-owned firm and Oil India Ltd (OIL) for auctioning in the second round of discovered small field (DSF).  The 72-square kilometer field near Jaisalmer in Rajasthan has 1,900 million standard cubic metres of reserves, an official of the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons said at the contract-signing ceremony with the winners of the 23 fields auctioned in DSF-II.  The 23 fields, made up of some 57 discoveries by ONGC and OIL, hold 190 million tonnes of oil and oil-equivalent gas resources, the official said.  Speaking on the occasion, Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said DSF bid rounds are aimed at raising domestic production to cut dependence on imported oil.  India is 83 per cent dependent on imports to meet its oil needs.  &amp;quot;Maximising production is the most important priority now,&amp;quot; he said.  While ONGC and OIL could not monetise the discoveries auctioned in the DSF round mainly due to they being financially unviable on prevalent fiscal terms, DSF round winners will get complete pricing and marketing freedom that will make the finds economically viable.  Pradhan said ONGC was asked to largely stay away from DSF-I round last year but was given freedom to bid in DSF-II and he was happy that the company walked away with the most number of fields.  Chinnewala Tibba was the most-contested field in DSF-II with as many as 17 bids being put in. ONGC won the field as also four others after bid evaluation and award was completed last week.  Contracts for the same were signed Thursday. OIL and Vedanta Ltd signed contracts for two fields each they had won while lesser known Ganges Geo-Resources Pvt Ltd signed for five fields.  State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and its partner Hindustan Oil Exploration Company Ltd (HOEC) signed for one field they won in the auction.  Arch Softwares Pvt Ltd, a firm backed by former Cairn India executive Suniti Bhat, won two offshore fields.  The remaining fields went to little-known firms such as Shanti GD Ispat Power, Arsh Corporate Services, Invenire Energy, Keerthi Industries, and Gem Petro E&amp;amp;amp;P.  On the contract signing, Vedanta Resources Ltd Executive Chairman Anil Agarwal said: &amp;quot;The Government of India has taken concrete steps to encourage and thus enhance domestic crude oil production, in line with Minister Pradhan's vision of energy self-sufficiency. The discovered small fields Round-II auction is another significant step in this direction. We remain committed to optimising exploration and production from the fields awarded to us. These reformative steps and our demonstrated success will pave the way for attracting future foreign investments as well.&amp;quot;  Sudhir Mathur, chief executive officer of oil and gas business of Vedanta Ltd, said the company is known for its engineering strength and innovation, especially in the tight oil and tight gas domain. &amp;quot;We are excited to bring these strengths to bear in the two new DSF fields awarded to us. We congratulate the government on all of these progressive initiatives that will lead to growth in the sector, job creation, and prosperity for our country.&amp;quot;  As many as 39 firms, including six foreign players, had put in 145 bids for 24 out of the 25 oil and gas fields on offer in DSF-II at the close of bidding on January 30. Mining giant Vedanta put in the highest number of bids for 21 fields.  A DGH statement said one bid for a field has been kept in abeyance as the matter is sub-judice.  ONGC and OIL had put in bids for 10 fields each while Indian Oil Corp (IOC) bid for 3.  British company Soco International made its foray into India, bidding for one field but it failed to make a dent. Arch Softwares had put in bids for 15 fields.","Business, Market news, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Oil India Ltd, ONGC","Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,ONGC,Oil India,Chinnewala Tibba gas field,Dharmendra Pradhan",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-wins-back-chinnewala-tibba-gas-field-contracts-signed-for-23-oilgas-fields-under-dsf-ii_12224441.html
2019-02-28T14:10:53+05:30,ONGC,RN Bhaskar,Tripura likely to see a business boom but challenges remain,Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb is optimistic about improving the quality of rubber production as well as the yield.,"RN Bhaskar  In the coming years, businessmen will witness the emergence of Agartala as the hub for transportation to the Northeast, and of Chittagong as the biggest trans-shipment hub in the Bay of Bengal.&nbsp; It remains to be seen if Agartala will be able to capitalise on this geo-political advantage.  In some &nbsp;ways, Tripura has been luckier than most other North Eastern states. &nbsp;Its decadal population growth has been quite close to the national decadal growth of population of 17.7% especially since the 1990s. There has been little influx of migrants since then. Moreover, with the state being bordered by Bangladesh on three sides &ndash; the fourth side is connected to India), the normalising of relations between Bangladesh and India has meant a great deal of peace for this state.    That is one reason why the state government now wants Tripura to notch up plans to become a big exporter of goods and services.&nbsp; Hitherto, it has largely been an importer.&nbsp; It imports rice, vegetables, clothes and building material. Even milk (often in the form of powder). Much of this is paid for by oil and gas (more on this later) and by the rubber industry.  Tripura remains the second largest producer of rubber in India (after Kerala) though the state has done nothing to put this distinction on the map of this country.&nbsp; Even the rubber board makes a passing reference to Tripura.  But go through the annual report of the Rubber Board, under the ministry of commerce&nbsp;and you will discover that Tripura does have major R&amp;amp;amp;D centres for rubber (pg 67 of the report).  But its contribution remains unknown and the private sector is also to be blamed. True, Tripura has the second largest number of licensed dealers in India for rubber &ndash; Kerala has 6,686, but Tripura trails at 529 (country total 8,252 -- pg 81 of the report), And when it comes to applying for additional licences in 2016-17, there were 734 applications from Kerala, and only 4 from Tripura.  The state accounts for around 60,000-80,000 tonnes out of the 690,000 tonnes of rubber produced annually (the state website does not provide any information on this). Information has to be obtained from secondary sources. More details about rubber production can be obtained from here.  Yet the Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb is optimistic about improving the quality of production as well as the yield. He points to the fact that Tripura has lots of natural gas. Oil India and ONGC have their presence in this state&nbsp;and Vedanta is trying to have a presence here.  Deb is trying to lure investors to use natural gas to extract carbon black which can be used with natural rubber for tyre production.  &amp;quot;We are trying to persuade investors to come here and use our resources,&rdquo; he told this correspondent. The fact remains that India is a booming market. It is the fourth largest tyre market in the world. The industry itself accounted for an annual turnover of $ 12,700 million in the year 2015-16, with the tyre sector contributing to $7,600 million, non-tyre sector $ 5,100 million and export $ 2,300 million. India is the sixth largest producer of natural rubber, and the second largest consumer of natural rubber (for industries as diverse as balls to balloons)  Another industry Tripura is focussed on is milk. It believes it could be a major player in the dairy farming and livestock rearing business. In December 2018, a team from Amul (actually Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation) flew into Agartala to work out ways with the state to develop dairy farming there.  The North East holds out the biggest promise of dairy development.&nbsp; It has lots of water, foliage and chaff. NDDB is already promoting a milk collection centre and cooperative farms in Guwahati while Amul could be setting up its centre in Tripura.  The North East imports milk (usually milk powder) worth around Rs.18,000 crore each year, with Tripura accounts for Rs 1,100 crore).&nbsp; Tripura will now be connected through Chittagong to almost all the other South East Asian countries which are also milk-deficient.&nbsp; Thus, Tripura could have two major markets &ndash; North East India, and south east Asia. &nbsp;Of course, this will also make it a hub for meat and leather-goods as well.  Another focus area is travel and tourism.&nbsp; Tripura has some of the most picturesque spots &ndash; lake palaces, sanctuaries and places of exquisite natural beauty. But the chief minister&rsquo;s primary focus is on spiritual tourism.&nbsp; His reasoning is simple.&nbsp; Some of the holiest of shrines &ndash; especially those related to Shiva and Devi &ndash; can be found here.&nbsp; Pilgrims are less fussy about accommodation and travel comforts.&nbsp; So that could be a good place to start.&nbsp; The improvement in accessibility by air, road, river and rail will only help the state bring in more tourists.  &amp;quot;Today, we do not have a single four-star or five-star hotel. We will improve our lodges in our places of tourism, and then begin advertising them as well,&amp;quot; he says.  Travel and tourism is indeed a great way to make money, increase visibility and create employment.  There are other markets as well.&nbsp; Tripura imports around 20,000 tonnes of fish annually (from Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Bangladesh).&nbsp; It has already created nurseries for fish fingerlings for farmers as every rural household has a backyard pond. The government wants to boost fisheries both for local consumption as well as for exports.  But a big ambitious plan is medical tourism.&nbsp; Almost 85,000 Bangladeshis come to India each year, spending almost Rs 4 lakh each, for medical needs.&nbsp; Deb wants to change this.&nbsp; He has already offered the two biggest hospitals in Agartala to the largest hospital chains in India.  &ldquo;We are in discussions. Once we clinch the deal, it will benefit both Tripura and the Bangladeshis. We will develop the medical tourism business, while the Bangladesh patients will save at least Rs 1 lakh on travel, because we are next door,&amp;quot; he says.    New varieties of rice and fish feed are being developed.&nbsp; So is cattle feed for the cows.&nbsp; The state has already given away some 1,000 cows, and wants to increase the population by 10,000 more within a couple of years.  All this could be good news to investors and businessmen.&nbsp; But there is a fly in the ointment.&nbsp; Such plans are not backed up with data.&nbsp; The state&rsquo;s websites have little or no information.&nbsp; Even figures sent to the government are missing.&nbsp; Take the Economic survey for instance (see table). Data for Tripura is missing.  Unless you have reliable data, you cannot plan reliably.&nbsp; Money does not come easily into places where there is uncertainty.&nbsp; Data lends credibility and certainty. If only the state could do that, it is quite possible that investors will begin to flock there.

2019-02-21T19:30:05+05:30,ONGC,PTI,"Govt asks ONGC, OIL to sell out 66 fields to pvt firms",They have been allowed to retain another 52 fields (49 by ONGC and 3 by OIL) where enhanced oil recovery or improved oil recovery programmes are already under implementation and they were put on production in the last four years.,"The government has asked state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) to sell out 66 of their small oil and gas fields to private firms as it brought in a new policy to boost domestic production and cut imports, Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Thursday.  To quickly bring all sedimentary basins under oil and gas exploration, the government dumped a two-year-old model of bidding out acreage or blocks to firms offering highest share of revenue, and brought in a new system of bidding them out on the basis of work programme such as drilling of wells and shooting of seismic with the winner's only liability being payment of statutory duties like royalty and cess, he told reporters here.  ONGC and OIL, who are battling stagnation in output from largely ageing fields, have a total of 184 fields. The national oil companies have been asked to provide enhanced production profile for 66 of these fields, which contribute 95 per cent of the 36 million tonne of annual oil production in the country, and given freedom to induct private and foreign partners or technology providers.  They have been allowed to retain another 52 fields (49 by ONGC and 3 by OIL) where enhanced oil recovery or improved oil recovery programmes are already under implementation and they were put on production in the last four years.  For the remaining 66 fields (64 belonging to ONGC and 2 to OIL), which currently contribute about 5 per cent of total output, will be bid out or privatised with revenue share going to the two firms.  Giving details of the decisions taken by the Cabinet earlier this week, Pradhan said companies will be given pricing and marketing freedom for yet-to-be-developed discoveries and will levy a lesser royalty in case of state-owned firms raising production from existing fields.  Marketing and pricing freedom will be given to those new gas discoveries whose field development plan (FDP) or investment proposal is yet to be approved. This would apply to both state producers like ONGC and private ones like Reliance.  ONGC is sitting on two dozen discoveries which it had not been able to produce because of the current government-mandated price being less than the cost of production. Reliance also has discoveries in east coast block NEC-25 where it can produce after the new freedom.  An incentive to produce additional gas from APM or nomination fields of state-owned firms like ONGC and OIL will be given in form of royalty reduction at the rate of 10 per cent on additional production over and above business as usual (BAU) scenario, which will be approved by the upstream regulator, DGH.  Pradhan said the alongside, the government has decided to award future exploration acreage based on exploration work commitment, which will replace a two-year-old method of awarding them to companies offering the highest revenue share to the government.  Exploration blocks in Category-I basins, where commercial production of hydrocarbon has already been established, will be bid out on the basis of a mix of work commitment and revenue share in the ratio of 70:30, he said.  Exploration blocks in Category II and III basins will be awarded purely based on the exploration work programme, he said adding winning company's only liability would be to pay royalty and cess and there would be no profit share.  &amp;quot;There will be no revenue or production sharing in these contracts but the government will get a share in case of windfall gains,&amp;quot; he said adding that the trigger for such a sharing has been fixed at USD 2.5 billion in a financial year from the block.  Pradhan said the focus of the new policy is to raise output from the existing fields and bring newer areas under production quickly.  &amp;quot;Revenue or profit is no longer the priority. Production will be,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Fiscal incentive is being given for early monetisation of discoveries.&amp;quot;  National oil companies (NOCs) have been given freedom to bid out fields and induct technology partners. &amp;quot;Bidding process will be decided by the NOCs,&amp;quot; he said adding the process is expected to be completed in four months.  The BJP-led NDA government had two years ago moved from production-sharing contracts, where acreage for exploration of oil and gas was allocated to firms offering the largest work programmes (such as carrying out seismic survey and drilling of wells), to revenue sharing contracts, where the firm offering highest revenue to the government was given the blocks.  In the older system, the explorer was guaranteed that his entire cost will be allowed to be recovered once commercially exploitable oil and gas is found. But in revenue sharing contract, the cost has no bearing and the companies are supposed to bid the revenue or production that they would give to the government at different levels of output and price.  The move to revenue sharing was despite several industry players stating that prospectivity in the country was poor and there was a need to give incentives to companies for exploration.  India has 26 sedimentary basins measuring 3.14 million square kilometers. These are classified into four categories: Category-I basins where commercial production has been established like Cambay, Mumbai Offshore, Rajasthan, Krishna Godavari, Cauvery, Assam Shelf and Assam-Arakan fold belt; Category-II basins with known accumulation of hydrocarbons but no commercial production so far such as Kutch, Mahanadi-NEC (North East Coast), Andaman-Nicobar and Kerala-Konkan-Lakshadweep.  The category-III basins have hydrocarbon reserves that are considered geologically prospective such as in Himalayan Foreland basin, Ganga Basin, Vindhyan basin, Saurashtra basin, Kerela Konkan basin, Bengal basin; and Category-IV which are the ones having uncertain potential which may be prospective by analogy with similar basins in the world. These include Karewa basin, Spiti-Zanskar basin, Satpura&ndash;South Rewa&ndash;Damodar basin, Chhattisgarh basin, Narmada basin, Deccan Syneclise, Bhima-Kaladgi, Bastar basin, Pranhita Godavari basin and Cuddapah basin.","Business, Companies, Economy, government, oil, ONGC","government,economy,business,companies,ONGC,OIL",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/govt-asks-ongc-oil-to-sell-out-66-fields-to-pvt-firms_12172281.html

2019-01-06T08:15:13+05:30,ONGC,Deepak Shenoy,ONGC first gets forced to buy HPCL and now buy its own shares back,"This situation has arisen because the government needs to meet its divestment target of Rs 80,000 crore by the end of this fiscal","Deepak Shenoy Capitalmind  We have some big numbers here.  This is, in fact, the summary of the borrowings of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) during FY17-18. In FY16-17 they had no borrowings. In fact, during the previous several years they had zero borrowings. This is a cash-rich company because that's what a Big Oil company is.  But now, they not only have slimmed their coffers but also picked up loans, like people pick-up vegetables during a discount rush. And all that because of some ill-considered decisions taken by our present Central government regarding this PSU company.  The reason ONGC took on debt was for purchasing Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) from the government. The government owns both ONGC and HPCL, but it needed money, so it forced ONGC to buy its ownership of HPCL for a whopping Rs 36,000 crore, for which ONGC borrowed about Rs 24,000 crore.  But ONGC is hugely cash-flow positive, and in the first six months after this report, it reduced its debt to just Rs 14,000 crore.  The reason for pointing this sticky situation out is that the Central government recently directed cash-rich&nbsp;state-run companies that have a lot of idle capital, to utilise it by handing out dividends and carrying out buybacks. Why? Because they need to meet their Rs 80,000 crore divestment target.  That means that even ONGC (even after buying HPCL) has to roll out dividends and buybacks. However, considering its current position, ONGC says it can either do a buyback or pay dividends, or better, neither, until the next financial year.  While they are still pleading the Ministry of Finance to exempt dividend, unfortunately, due to pressures from the government, they have agreed to carry out the buyback. The buyback is for 2.34 percent of its shareholders' capital, which comes to Rs 4,022 crore. The record date set for both is January 4.  Now the question is how is ONGC going to pull this off? Answer: It can't and it doesn't have the cash anymore. Not unless ONGC picks up more loans, or reduces its efforts to pay back the loans it currently has.  Can ONGC get cash elsewhere? First, they can look at the profits that would be generated in Q3&nbsp;and Q4. They generate a cash profit of over Rs 5,000 crore almost each quarter.  Secondly, ONGC holds around 134 crore shares in IOC and IOC recently declared dividends and buyback. If you look at only the dividend aspect, IOC will pay Rs 6.75 per share. For ONGC that means around Rs 903 crore. Then there's the buyback as well.  The IOC buyback is for about 3 percent of its shares at Rs 149. Assuming ONGC sells back 3 percent of its holding to IOC, that's 3 percent of 134 crore shares&nbsp;or 4 crore shares at Rs 149. This is about Rs 600 crore.  Finally, ONGC has received $32 million from PDVSA, as part settlement of outstanding dividend payments (ONGC owns 40 percent stake in Venezuela's San Cristobal project). Assuming $1 =&nbsp;Rs 70, this comes to Rs 224 crore.  So, they get about Rs 1,700 crore from dividends/buybacks of their holdings. That provides them with about 40 percent of what they need for the buyback, and the rest (of the Rs 4,022 crore) will have to be sequestered from their profits of the two quarters.  Their goal of being debt free may have to wait. They were supposed to pay back the entire loan they took to buy HPCL within a year. But that may extend another six months&nbsp;if it has to do this buyback and pay a dividend.  All in all ONGC seems to be in a tough (but not impossible) situation. They generate enough cash to be able to pull it off.  The problem, however, is that the government as the primary shareholder gets in the way of efficient functioning. We could analyse this and say ONGC has the money for now, but what if the greedy government keeps wanting more? As a shareholder, this might not be exciting.  It also tells you the perils of investing in a government-owned company, but at least they siphon off the money after telling you about it. In most other companies, you don't even get to know about how much money&rsquo;s been looted.

The consolidated revenues at Rs 1,22,029 crore climbed up 46% from Rs 83,619 crore recorded in the corresponding quarter last year. On a sequential basis, consolidated revenues are up 13% from Rs. 1,08,136 crore reported in the previous quarter.  &ldquo;During the quarter, the company has decided to opt for lower tax regime u/s 115BAA of the Income Tax Act, 1961, with effect from FY 2020-21.

This tax write back of Rs 7,195 crore has inflated the bottom line in this quarter.  The company benefitted from higher crude realizations and higher prices of value added products.  Crude and Gas Realizations  The company&rsquo;s nominated crude realizations improved 68% y-o-y from Rs 3,078/bbl to Rs 5,139/bbl (USD 69.36 in Q2FY22 vs USD 41.38 in Q2FY21).

However, the gas realizations for the company declined 25% y-o-y from USD 2.39/mmbtu to USD 1.79/mmbtu.  Crude and Gas Production  The production of both crude and gas for the company declined during the quarter due to COVID-related restrictions in many parts of the country.  The company&rsquo;s own crude oil production was down 3% y-o-y to 4.68 million metric tonne (MMT) while its JV produced 4.3% lower volume at 0.56 MMT in this quarter. Condensate production declined 17% y-o-y to 0.24 MMT.  Total gas production during the quarter (ONGC+JVs) was down 7% y-o-y from 5.88 billion cubic meters in the previous year (BCM) to 5.47 BCM in this quarter. Production of value added products also declined 4.7% from 826 kilo tonne (Kt) last year to 787 Kt in this quarter.  &ldquo;The production of crude oil and gas has declined during current year mainly due to restrictive conditions created by cyclone Tauktae and due to Covid impact&rdquo;, the company said.  Operating Margins &nbsp;  The increase in Brent Crude prices helped the operating margins of the company to improve from 32.8% last year to 48.2% in this quarter.  Dividend  ONGC has approved interim dividend of 110%, i.e. Rs 5.50 on each equity share of Rs 5. The total payout on this account will be Rs 6,919 Crore.

2021-10-05T14:39:54+05:30,ONGC,PTI,"Gas price increase positive for ONGC, Reliance Industries: Fitch","The price for gas from fields that were assigned by the state to oil companies, mainly Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL), increased to USD 2.90 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) for October 2021-March 2022, from USD 1.79 per mmBtu in the previous six months.","The 62 percent increase in natural gas prices by the Indian government will boost the profitability of upstream companies in the country and support their investment spending, Fitch Ratings said on Tuesday.  The price for gas from fields that were assigned by the state to oil companies, mainly Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL), increased to USD 2.90 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) for October 2021-March 2022, from USD 1.79 per mmBtu in the previous six months.  &amp;quot;Higher gas prices will increase the input cost for key end-consumer sectors, to the extent the price hike is passed on,&amp;quot; Fitch said.  Domestically produced gas is supplied on a priority basis to certain sectors, with 30 percent of it being consumed by power producers, around 27 percent by the fertiliser sector and 19 percent by city gas distributors in FY21.  The gas price increase will hit the fertiliser sector's profitability by increasing working-capital requirements, Fitch said.  Auto gas fuel's price will remain competitive against liquid fuels, albeit with a reduced differential, notwithstanding the gas price increase. This is because liquid auto fuel prices have also been climbing in recent months, given the rise in crude oil prices.  The cost of power generated by gas-based power plants will increase, which will further decrease their utilisation.  &amp;quot;ONGC's and OIL's ratings and standalone credit profiles (SCP) remain unchanged as the price increase was largely in line with Fitch's expectations, driven by the rise in global prices over July 2020-June 2021,&amp;quot; the rating agency said in a statement.  However, sustained high gas prices will strengthen ONGC's &amp;quot;bbb+&amp;quot; SCP and will add buffer to OIL's credit metrics, which will support its capex to expand capacity at subsidiary Numaligarh Refinery Ltd.  The government also increased the price ceiling for gas produced from deepwater and other difficult fields to USD 6.13 per mmBtu from USD 3.62 per mmBtu.  &amp;quot;Reliance Industries Ltd's gas production from KG basin will benefit from the higher price ceiling, but the impact on RIL's financial profile is minimal as gas makes a limited contribution to its revenue,&amp;quot; Fitch said.  The rating agency estimated ONGC's net leverage, measured by net debt/EBITDA, to improve to around 2.1x in the financial year ending March 2022 (FY22) from 2.7x in FY21 as upstream earnings recover and downstream earnings stay resilient.  Natural gas' share of consolidated revenues is in the mid-single digits for ONGC, given its integrated business model.  It expects OIL's FY22 leverage to be 1.9x. Natural gas accounted for about 13 percent of OIL's upstream revenue in FY21, Fitch said.  Disclaimer: MoneyControl is a part of the Network18 group.

MIEL is the first private company in India to manufacture oil and gas extraction rigs with indigenous technology, a company statement said.","Infrastructure company MEIL said it has delivered the second oil rig to ONGC, and another 21 rigs will be supplied to the state-owned firm by 2022.  The delivery is a part of the Rs 6,000 crore order Megha Engineering and Infrastructures Ltd (MEIL) had won from ONGC for the supply of 47 rigs. MIEL is the first private company in India to manufacture oil and gas extraction rigs with indigenous technology, a company statement said.  An oil rig is a structure with equipment for drilling an oil well.  Outfitted with advanced hydraulic technology, the second rig is set to begin operations at an oil well near GGS-IV oil field near Kalol in Gujarat, under ONGC Ahmedabad Asset. By March 2022, 23 rigs will be delivered to ONGC. The aim is to hand over all the 47 rigs at the earliest, the company said.  &amp;quot;MEIL is also planning to expand its overall business to up to USD 2 billion in coming days by manufacturing indigenous rigs. MEIL will manufacture and supply it in India and globally,&amp;quot; it said without divulging any further information.  The oil rigs manufactured by MEIL with advanced hydraulic technology dig oil wells faster and operates with minimal power. With a capacity of 1,500 HP, the rig can easily drill up to 4,000 metres. The rig is expected to be operational for 40 years and comes with the most modern technology, even in terms of security standards.  P Rajesh Reddy, Vice-President, MEIL, said India is importing 80 per cent oil products. Reducing dependence on energy imports is a must for the success of Make in India and Atmanirbhar Bharat. MEIL is proud to be contributing to both the initiatives and playing its part in boosting domestic oil production and securing the country&rsquo;s energy future.  The indigenous component level in the advanced rigs is 50 per cent at present, and will be increased to 90 per cent over time, he added.  &amp;quot;Until recently, India was mostly dependent on oil and fuel extraction rig imports, but MEIL has significantly boosted domestic rig manufacturing capacity. The second rig handed over to ONGC is manufactured with state-of-the-art hydraulic and automated technology. ONGC will benefit from these advanced rigs built with cutting-edge technology,&amp;quot; N Krishna Kumar, Head-Oil Rigs Division, MEIL said.  MEIL will manufacture and deliver the rigs to ONGC Assets in Assam (Shib Sagar, Jorhat), Andhra Pradesh (Rajahmundry), Gujarat (Ahmedabad, Ankleshwar, Mehsana and Cambay), Tripura (Agartala) and Tamil Nadu (Karaikal).

The 43 onland fields have been clustered into 11 contract areas that will be bid out to companies offering the highest oil and gas output on top of a pre-decided baseline, the company said in a statement.  ONGC had in June 2019 invited similar bids for 64 fields that were clustered into 17 contract areas. The bid round did not evoke much interest and failed.  &amp;quot;ONGC announces Notice Inviting Offer (NIO) seeking partners for enhancement of production from its marginal nomination fields in line with its goal of maximizing recovery from its producing fields,&amp;quot; the statement said.  The fields on offer have a total in-place oil and oil equivalent gas volume of about 160 million tonne.  &amp;quot;These contract areas are spread across the states of Gujarat, Assam, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh,&amp;quot; it said.  The 64 fields offered in 2019 held a cumulative 300 million tonne of oil and oil equivalent natural gas reserves.  The oil ministry has been unhappy with the near stagnant oil and gas production and believes giving out the discovered fields to private firms would help raise output as they can bring in technology and capital.  It has been tasked by the Prime Minister to cut dependence on oil imports by 10 per cent by 2022 from the over 77 per cent dependence in 2014-15. But the dependence has only increased and is now over 83 per cent.  &amp;quot;Eligible companies (Indian or foreign), either alone or in consortium with other companies, may bid for one or more contract areas,&amp;quot; the statement said adding the bidders are required to fulfill the requisite technical and financial criteria.  The last date for bidding is December 3.  A pre-bid conference will be held on October 20, 2021.  &amp;quot;Bidders interested in studying the data can purchase field information docket and data packages. Upon request, the interested companies shall be able to access the data viewing facility at IRS, Ahmedabad and visit the fields, if required,&amp;quot; it said.  ONGC said operators will have complete marketing and pricing freedom to sell hydrocarbons on an arm's length basis through competitive bidding.  &amp;quot;Partner will be selected on a revenue-sharing basis. The revenue will be shared on incremental production over and above the baseline production under business-as-usual (BAU) scenario,&amp;quot; it said.  The contract period will be for 15 years with an option to extend by 5 years.  &amp;quot;A reduction of 10 per cent in the royalty rate for incremental production of natural gas over and above BAU scenario&amp;quot; will be offered, it said.  Continuous exploration is permitted during the contract period including the right to explore all kinds of hydrocarbon.  Also, no past investment/ expenditure incurred by ONGC is to be shared or paid by the contractor.  While ease of entry/ exit will be provided, an incentive will also be given to enhance production beyond committed incremental production, ONGC added.","Business, Companies, ONGC","Business,companies,ONGC",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-seeks-partners-to-raise-output43-oil-gas-fields_15459521.html

This price, however, will be subject to the ceiling or cap fixed by the government for deepsea fields every six months. The cap for six months beginning April 1 is USD 3.62 per mmBtu.  This essentially means that bidders may corner gas by offering to pay USD 7, but the buyers will have to pay no more than the ceiling price of USD 3.62.  A senior&nbsp;ONGC&nbsp;official said the ceiling price is expected to rise to USD 5.5-5.6 at the next revision due on October 1.  &amp;quot;The current ceiling price is one-third less than the bare minimum cost of production from a deepsea field. After including the cost of money as well as margin, gas price should be USD 6 and not USD 3.62,&amp;quot; he said.  Earlier this month, Reliance Industries Ltd and its partner BP Plc of UK sought bids for the sale of 5.5 mmscmd of additional natural gas that will be available for sale from their eastern offshore KG-D6 block.  The e-auction is slated for April 23 and the gas supply will start from late April or early May, according to the tender document.  Bidders will have to quote a price linked to Platts JKM (Japan Korea marker) - the liquefied natural gas (LNG) benchmark price assessment for spot physical cargoes.  The lowest bid that can be placed is JKM minus USD 0.3 per million British thermal unit. The highest acceptable bid would be JKM plus USD 2.01 per mmBtu.  This is the same benchmark RIL-BP had used in February to sell out 7.5 mmscmd of gas from the block.  At the current price, the lowest price for the 5.5 mmscmd of gas that RIL-BP are auctioning comes to near USD 6.5 per mmBtu.  But just like ONGC, RIL-BP too is entitled to a maximum of USD 3.62 per mmBtu ceiling fixed by the government for a six-month period to September 30.  ONGC's KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5 block is expected to have a peak production rate of 15.25 mmscmd of natural gas and 80,000 barrels per day of oil.  The company is likely to come out with another tender later this year for the sale of 5 mmscmd of gas from next year.  &amp;amp;nbsp;  Disclaimer:&nbsp;&ldquo;Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media &amp;amp;amp; Investments Ltd.&rdquo;","Business, Krishna-Godavari basin, ONGC","Business,ONGC,Krishna Godavari basin,KG basin fields",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-seeks-buyers-for-kg-gas-wants-minimum-3666-price_15002441.html

While Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) maintained production levels, output by other operators has dropped, leading to an overall fall in India''s output and a sharp rise in import dependency.  Its standalone production at 47.51 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas in 2010-11 was 52.8 per cent of a total of 89.91 million tonnes of oil and gas produced in the country that year, the data showed.  Despite having majority of fields where natural decline has set after being in operations for more than four decades, ONGC maintained production throughout the last decade thereafter and had an output of 44.57 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas in 2019-20, which was 70.3 per cent of India''s total production of 63.353 million tonnes.  ONGC''s output dropped to 43.54 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas in 2015-16 (62.9 per cent of India''s total production) but new discoveries as well as massive investment in extracting last drop from the ageing fields arrested further fall and even led to a marginal increase.  Even when its production dropped when compared to previous year, ONGC''s share in total production of crude oil and natural gas in the country continued to rise, the data which formed part of the review taken by the ministry a couple of weeks back, showed.  ONGC is focused on finding oil and gas reserves in Category II and III Basins, which do not have established hydrocarbon proficiency.  This helped accrete inplace reserves of 2,246 million tonnes of oil between 2002 and 2015 and ultimate accretion of 1,014 million tonnes, the data presented at the review showed.  Of this, ONGC realised 830 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas as production. It has approved 14 schemes for developing 135 million tonnes of reserves.  ONGC''s share in national production rose from 52.8 per cent in 2010-11 to 54.9 per cent in the following year and to 58.7 per cent in 2012-13, 62.2 per cent in 2013-14, 62.3 per cent in 2014-15, 62.9 per cent in 2015-16 and 65.3 per cent in 2016-17.  In subsequent years it was 67 per cent, 68.4 per cent and 70.3 per cent in 2019-20 -- the latest year for which data was presented at the review.  During this 10-year period, India''s dependence on imported crude oil to meet its demand rose from about two-third to 85 per cent.  ONGC discovered and put to production seven out of the eight producing basins of India covering 83 per cent of established oil and gas reserves.  In December last year, it opened India''s eighth hydrocarbon producing basin when it started oil flow from a well in the Bengal basin. Oil India Ltd (OIL) is responsible for putting into production one basin in Assam.","Business, Companies, gas, ONGC","business,companies,ONGC,gas",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc39s-shareindia39s-oil-gas-production-jumps-to-7053-10-years-back_14932741.html

Oil India﻿ (OIL) won the remaining four blocks. ,"India will line up 10 oil and gas blocks under the sixth round of Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) for domestic and international hydrocarbon players, SCL Das, Director General, Directorate General of Hydrocarbons has said.  State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) had won seven out of 11 geographical areas on offer under the fifth bidding round held last year under the OALP. Oil India (OIL) won the remaining four blocks.  OALP Round V is expected to generate an immediate exploration work commitment of around $400-450 million. On the other hand, the first four rounds are expected to generate an investment of approximately $2.35 billion over the next three to four years in exploratory work alone.  Addressing international energy summit CERA Week 2021, he said the country wants more international investors to participate in the OALP and Discovered Small Fields (DSF) rounds.  Amar Nath, joint secretary at the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas added that the next round of small field auctions is expected to happen within the next two months.  Das indicated that for foreign players India will open up opportunities as demand is constantly on a rise in the country. According to data available with the DGH, demand for crude oil is likely to double from 5 million barrels per day now to 10 billion barrels by 2050. Similarly, the demand for natural gas may also increase to 241 billion cubic meter (bcm) by 2050 from around 58 bcm now.  &ldquo;To move towards this, we have lined up several policy reforms including revenue sharing model and unified licensing policy. Moreover, we have also introduced several fiscal incentive schemes,&rdquo; he said.","Business, DGH, Discovered small fields, Economy, India, OALP, Oil India, ONGC, stocks","OALP, Discovered small fields, DGH, ONGC, Oil India, crude oil, natural gas",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/cera-week-india-to-line10-hydrocarbon-blocks-under-round-vioalp_14899201.html

Brent prices have risen to USD65/bbl, driven by demand recovery, OPEC+ cuts, stimulus and extreme cold weather. Arrival of summer-driving season in US-Europe and shift to personal mobility should support oil prices further. Hence, there is upside risk to our USD55/bbl Brent assumption for FY22. Subsidy risk based on Union Budget and LPG price hikes is low in our view. ONGC management has remained upbeat on the government agreeing to remunerative gas pricing, which should at least cover the USD3.5-3.7/mmbtu cost of production. Every USD1/mmbtu rise in APM rate implies Rs2.6/sh EPS increase for the company.  Outlook We value ONGC at 4x FY23E EV/EBITDA to arrive at Rs130 TP, assuming USD2.3/2.7 APM prices for FY22/23. Under a blue sky scenario - USD60/bbl Brent, USD3.5/mmbtu gas price and KG-DWN-98/2 ramp up, FV comes above Rs170/sh.

Most of the future gas production is expected from the Krishna Godavari basin, where ONGC and Reliance Industries operate blocks. Reliance aims to produce 30 mmscmd gas by 2023 from its assets in the basin.  ONGC will ramp up production from its KG basin block to about 3-3.5 mmscmd from May, which will be further raised to 8.5 mmscmd in 2022/23 before hitting peak rate in 2024, Kumar said.  Combined output of Reliance and ONGC will be about 60&nbsp;percent of the average 77 mmscmd Indian companies produced in April-December 2020.  To make its gas business profitable ONGC has floated a new subsidiary and expects government to raise local prices.  Current local gas prices of $1.79/million British thermal units (mmBtu) have hit ONGC's revenue. The company's production cost is $3.5-$3.7/mmBtu, he said.  The company will spin-off its entire gas business into the new subsidiary. ONGC holds stake in downstream gas assets and overseas gas blocks either directly or through its subsidiaries.

The source declined to be named due to sensitivity of the matter.  The Biden administration on Wednesday eased sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector after the government and opposition parties reached a deal for&nbsp;the 2024 election, in the most extensive rollback of Trump-era restrictions on Caracas.  U.S. sanctions had hit Venezuela's finances and oil output, leading to accumulation of dividend for foreign companies such as ONGC.  ONGC, through its overseas investment ONGC Videsh, holds 40% stake in the San Cristobal field in eastern Venezuela's Orinoco Heavy Oil belt, and 11% in Carabobo area-1.

As per earlier guidance, management expects oil production from KG-DWN98/2 to commence by Aug&rsquo;23 in an optimistic scenario and by Oct&rsquo;23 in a worst-case scenario. The peak oil production is likely to be ~40-45kbopd. Although the levy of windfall tax by the Center with a fortnightly revision raised concerns on realizations of upstream companies, the government has adjusted windfall taxes in line with crude oil fluctuations. Our estimate suggests that the government is allowing a post-windfall realization of USD68-81/bbl and we expect it to remain at ~USD70/bbl from 2QFY24 onwards. The implementation of the Kirit Parikh Committee's recommendations from Apr'23 has provided the much-needed respite to the company, as it had to sell gas below the cost of production for quite a long time. We build in gas price assumptions of USD6.7/mmBtu for FY24-FY25E. Additionally, ~6-8% of APM gas production comes from new wells that will attract 20% premium as per the new pricing policy.  Outlook We value the standalone business at 6x FY25E adj. EPS of INR30.8 and add the value of investments to arrive at our TP of INR220, implying 24% potential upside.

Net oil/gas realisation of $74/bbl and $7.1/mmBtu was above estimate while employee/ other expenses declined sharply by 7%/28% q-o-q. Volume performance was mixed with in-line oil sales volume of 4.7mmt (up 1% q-o-q) and 2% miss in gas sales volume at 4.1bcm (down 1.1% q-o-q). We increase our FY24/FY25 earnings estimate by 6%/9% to factor lower opex. The current pricing mechanism provides earnings visibility but capping of oil &amp;amp;amp; gas realisation limits any earnings surprise over FY24-25 unless KG 98/2 block sees faster ramp-up. Any significant benefit from 20% premium on APM gas price cap of $6.5/ mmBtu for gas production from new wells needs to be watched before building any likely improvement in gas price going forward.

However, the company&rsquo;s standalone net profit tanked 34 percent to Rs 10,015 crore in the quarter, from Rs 15,206 crore in last year.  Revenue from operations declined 10 percent to Rs 1.63 lakh crore in the June quarter, as against Rs 1.82 lakh crore in the same period last year,&nbsp;ONGC said in an exchange filing.  Crude oil output of the company declined 3.3 percent to 5.311 million metric tonnes (MMT) from 5.495 MMT in year-ago period. Similarly, gas output was 3 percent lower in the quarter compared to last year.  The company said output in the quarter declined on account of shutdown in Panna-Mukta offshore platforms and cyclone Biparjoy.  &ldquo;The reduction in ONGC's production output in Q1 FY 2023-24 was due to: a. Shutdown in Panna-Mukta offshore platforms for commissioning of new crude oil pipeline to modernise its evacuation facilities, post taking over from JV Partners. b. Cyclone Biparjoy (June 2023) disrupted offshore and onshore production. c. Crude oil wells in southern India had to be stopped as a refinery there stopped receiving oil, following a leakage in their pipeline,&rdquo; the company said in a press release.  ONGC said current output decline was temporary and it would be compensated in the upcoming quarters.  To counter the decline in production from some of the matured and marginal fields, the company is taking proactive steps by implementing well interventions and advancing new well drilling activities, said ONGC post-results.  &ldquo;The current decline in production is temporary. The same will be compensated in upcoming quarters with commencement of additional production from new projects; especially by crude oil production commencement from KG 98/2 in Q3 2023-24,&rdquo; the company said.  In the first quarter of FY24, ONGC declared total four discoveries (1 in onland and 3 in offshore) in its operated acreages. Out of these, 3 are prospect (offshore) and 1 pool discovery (onland).

2023-05-29T14:39:33+05:30,ONGC,PTI,"ONGC Videsh has less than $100 million stuck in Russia, says official",Indian state oil firms have invested USD 5.46 billion in buying stakes in four different assets in Russia. These include a 49.9 per cent stake in the Vankorneft oil and gas field and another 29.9 per cent in the TAAS-Yuryakh Neftegazodobycha fields.,"India's flagship overseas firm ONGC Videsh has less than USD 100 million of dividend income lying&nbsp;in Russia because of Ukraine conflict but the company is not in a hurry to bring it back, a senior official said on Monday.  Indian state oil firms have invested USD 5.46 billion in buying stakes in four different assets in Russia. These include a 49.9 per cent stake in the Vankorneft oil and gas field and another 29.9 per cent in the TAAS-Yuryakh Neftegazodobycha fields.  They get dividends on profits made by the operating consortium from selling oil and gas produced from the fields. Soon after invading Ukraine in February last year, Russia put restrictions on repatriation of dollars to check volatility in foreign exchange rates.  OVL, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), got its last dividend back in July 2022. One dividend payout that came after that is lying in the company's account in Russia.  Its managing director Rajarshi Gupta said the dividend income lying in Russia is &amp;quot;less than USD 100 million.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;We are not in a hurry to get it back as the company has capital and operating expenses for the three projects in Russia,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;It is business as usual as far as dividend is concerned.&amp;quot; OVL holds interest in Russia through a Singapore subsidiary.  Moscow declared Singapore as an unfriendly nation last year and so money from Russia cannot flow to any company incorporated in that country.  He said the company is looking at right banking channels and discussions are on. Last week, Oil India officials said USD 300 million dividend income of the company and its partners are stuck in Russia.  The consortium of OIL, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Bharat PetroResources Ltd has stakes in two projects.  The USD 300 million dividend was lying with the Commercial Indo Bank LLC (CIBL), which was a joint venture of State Bank of India and Canara Bank. Canara Bank in March sold its 40 per cent stake in CIBL to SBI.  The dividend from TAAS was paid on a quarterly basis, while Vankorneft's earnings were paid half-yearly. The Indian firms are looking at options of how to repatriate the money from Russia, he said.  OVL holds a 26 per cent stake in Suzunskoye, Tagulskoye and Lodochnoye fields -- collectively known as the Vankor cluster in the north-eastern part of West Siberia.  Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Oil India Ltd (OIL) and Bharat PetroResources Ltd (a unit of Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd or BPCL) hold another 23.9 per cent in Vankor. Russia's Rosneft is the operator with 50.1 per cent interest.  The consortium of OIL, IOC and Bharat PetroResources has a 29.9 per cent stake in TAAS-Yuryakh Neftegazodobycha. The operations of the fields have not been impacted and they continue to produce as normal.  OVL also has a 20 per cent stake in the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas field in Far East Russia, and in 2009 acquired Imperial Energy, which has fields in Siberia, for USD 2.1 billion.  OVL, which has 32 oil and gas properties in 15 countries from Venezuela to Vietnam, had seen oil production fall to 6.349 million tonne in 2022-23 fiscal (April 2022 to March 2023) from 8.099 million tonne in the previous year.  Gas output also dipped to 3.822 billion cubic meters from 4.231 bcm in 2021-22. The lower production was because of halting of operations at Sakhalin-1 for seven months after operator Exxon declared force majure post Ukraine war.  But higher oil prices help it post a net profit of Rs 1,700 crore in FY23 as against a PAT of Rs 1,589 crore in the previous fiscal.","Business, Companies, ONGC, ONGC Videsh, Russia","business,companies,ONGC Videsh,ONGC,Russia",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-videsh-has-less-than-36100-million-stuckrussia-says-official_17043571.html

The net profit for the fourth quarter of FY23 stood at Rs 5,701 crore, compared to Rs 12,061.44 crore in the corresponding period last year.  As of 10.15 AM, ONGC was trading at Rs 157.60 per share on the National Stock Exchange, reflecting a 3.76 percent decrease from the previous closing price of Rs 163.75.  The company reported a rise in its consolidated total income in Q4FY23 to Rs 166,728.80 crore, against Rs 158,660.49 crore in the year-ago quarter.  On a standalone basis, the company reported a net loss of Rs 248 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 2023 (Q4FY23), compared to the Rs 8,860 crore net profit recorded in the same period of the previous year.  Standalone gross revenue for the state-run oil and gas major increased by 5.2 percent to Rs 36,293 crore from Rs 34,497 crore in the year-ago period.  The company said that its bottom line was hit due to a provision of Rs 12,107 crore made in the quarter towards disputed Service tax and GST on royalty and interest on it in the period between April 1, 2016 and to March 31, 2023.  The company also said that this has been done as a prudent practice, adding, &ldquo;it shall continue to contest such disputed matters before various forums based on the legal opinion&rdquo;.  The company's Board has recommended a final dividend of Rs 0.5 per equity share for FY 2022-23.&nbsp;The total dividend for FY&rsquo;23 would be 225% (Rs.11.25 per share of face value Rs 5 each) with a total payout of Rs. 14,153 crore. This includes interim dividend of 215% (Rs. 10.75 per share) already paid during the year.  Catch up on all LIVE stock market updates here  During FY 2022-23, ONGC announced a total of eight discoveries, with five on land and three offshore. Among these, three are prospects (two on land and one offshore), while five are pools (three on land and two offshore).  The crude oil (Nominated) realisation for the quarter stood at $77.12 per barrel which is down by 18.8 percent compared to the realisation of $94.98 per barrel during the corresponding period last year.  In rupee terms, the average crude realisation was Rs 6,344 per barrel, 11.2 percent down year-on-year (YoY).  Total crude production during the quarter remained at 5.23 million metric tonnes (mmt) compared to 5.39 million metric tonnes (mmt) produced during the same period a year ago.  The gas production during the quarter was down 1.5 percent on-year to 5.26 billion cubic metres (BCM) compared to 5.33 BCM a year ago.  The production of value-added products dipped 18.7 percent on-year to 612 kilotonnes (KT) from 753 KT.  ONGC's 4Q FY23 standalone EBITDA significantly declined due to various factors: a sharp increase in dry well write-off, lower net crude realization, and a substantial exceptional expense for disputed taxes, said JM Financial Institutional Securities. Production at OVL--wholly owned and overseas subsidiary--gradually recovered, and there was a higher PAT due to the reversal of an impairment charge. The final dividend was limited, leading to a 40 percent payout for FY23. PAT estimates for FY24 and FY25 were reduced, resulting in a revised target price, it said. Despite this, the brokerage firm has maintained its &lsquo;buy&rsquo; rating on ONGC stock due to the attractive dividend yield and the market price discounting lower net crude realisation.","Buzzing Stocks, ONGC, ONGC Q4 results, Q4 results, Results","Buzzing Stocks, ONGC, ONGC Q4 results, Q4 results, Results",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/results/ongc-shares-slide-4-as-consolidated-net-profit-declines-53q4_17037761.html

Oil/gas sales declined by 7.9%/2.6% y-o-y to 4.7mmt/4.2bcm; net crude oil realisation increased 6% q-o-q to $76.7/bbl (gross realisation of $87.1/bbl minus SAED impact of $10.4/bbl). OVL posted PAT of Rs. 549 crore (versus loss of Rs. 440 crore in Q2FY2023), while MRPL reported net loss of Rs. 188 crore due to subdued GRM of $3.9/bbl. Management has guided for production growth of 1%/4-5% for FY2023E/FY2024E with KG 98/2 to witness peak production in FY2025. In our view, earnings of upstream PSUs would peak in FY2023 and decline going forward due to likely capping of domestic gas price and normalisation a crude oil price. Likely withdrawal of windfall tax is key to improve investor sentiments.  Outlook We maintain our Hold rating on ONGC with a revised PT of Rs. 165. The stock trades at 4.8x/0.7x its FY2025E EPS/BV and offers high dividend yield of ~8%.

Compared to the September quarter, the profit was down 14 percent from Rs 12,826 crore.  Standalone revenue for the state-run oil and gas major surged 36 percent to Rs 38,583 crore from Rs 28,473 crore in the year-ago period. On a sequential basis, the revenue was flat with a marginal gain of one percent from Rs 38,321 crore.  &ldquo;Uncertainties and constraints across the global supply chain due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict have adversely affected the production of crude oil and gas&rdquo;, the company said in its earnings release.  Significant peaks in energy prices and political stands of different nations in the aforementioned matter have impacted energy productivity, affordability, and cost inflation, besides the lingering aftermath of the restrictive conditions due to the COVID pandemic, the company added.  Also Read:&nbsp;ONGC to reverse oil, gas output decline; sees 18% jump in production in FY25  The growth in revenue and earnings was driven largely by a surge in APM gas prices compared to last year, but it was negated partially by a muted growth in volumes for both oil and gas businesses.  The crude oil (nominated) realisation for the quarter stood at $87.13 per barrel which is higher by 15.1 percent compared to the realisation of $75.73 per barrel during the corresponding period last year.  In rupee terms, the average crude realisation was Rs 7,162 per barrel, 26.2 percent higher year-on-year (YoY).  However, total crude production during the quarter remained flat at 5.4 million metric tonnes (mmt) compared to 5.45 mmt produced during the same period a year ago.  The price of gas on a gross calorific value basis jumped 196 percent to $8.57 per million metric British Thermal Unit (mmbtu) from $2.9 mmbtu during the same period a year ago.  Also Read:&nbsp;ONGC: Arun Kumar Singh is now CEO as well  The gas production during the quarter was down 4 percent on-year to 5.35 billion cubic metres (BCM) compared to 5.57 BCM a year ago.  The production of value-added products dipped 16 percent on-year to 642 kilotonnes (KT) from 763 KT.  The operating costs for the quarter witnessed a jump both on a YoY as well as a sequential basis with an increase in other expenses, cost of raw material and exploration costs which impacted the operating margins.  The operating margins for the quarter at 39.8 percent were down 235 basis points on-year and 462 basis points on a QoQ basis.  ONGC has declared a total of seven discoveries (four on land and three offshore) during FY2022-23 so far in its operated acreages.

Mandapeta-60 and Kesanapalli West Deep-7 have been monetised by ONGC.  The company has declared a second interim dividend of Rs 4 per equity share of the face value of Rs 5 each which works out at a rate of 80 percent for the Financial Year 2022-23.

","ONGC Ltd, the state-owned Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas major, is forecasted to witness a 28.3 percent year-on-year jump in its standalone profit after tax (PAT) for the quarter ended December, 2022. The growth in revenue and earnings is likely to be driven by a surge in APM gas prices which zoomed ~3x YoY and 40 percent QoQ.  The crude prices after the impact of the windfall tax are likely to remain stable on a yearly basis. This positive impact of higher prices, however, is partially negated by muted volumes in both its oil and gas business streams.  The &lsquo;Navratna&rsquo; company is slated to declare its results for the quarter ended December 2022 on Tuesday, February 14.    According to a poll of brokerages conducted by Moneycontrol, ONGC is forecasted to report a standalone PAT of Rs 11,242 crore for the quarter with the standalone revenues likely to clock Rs 38,359 crore.  The company had recorded a standalone PAT of Rs 8,764 crore during the corresponding period of last year on revenues of Rs 28,473 crore.  During the preceding quarter of the current fiscal, the standalone PAT stood at Rs 12,826 crore on revenues of Rs 38,321 crore.  What do brokerages expect?  Emkay India Equity Research  The brokerage and research firm expects the revenue to jump 36 percent on year and one percent sequentially to Rs 38,737 crore, and expects earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 18,609 crore, a growth of 25.3 percent on year and 15.6 percent QoQ.  It expects a PAT of Rs 10,651 crore, which is a YoY growth of 21.5 percent. Sequentially, however, the PAT is likely to be down 17 percent due to higher other income in the previous quarter.  Emkay expects &ldquo;net crude oil realisation at $ 84.7 per barrel, gas up 43-44 percent QoQ, while crude oil/gas production volumes expected to decline by 1 percent and 5 percent YoY each.&rdquo;  Kotak Institutional Equities  Kotak pegs the standalone revenues for the company to grow at 38 percent on year and 2.4 percent QoQ to Rs 39,242 crore, while EBITDA is forecasted to grow at ~30 percent YoY and 10 percent sequentially to Rs 20,687 crore.  &ldquo;We model overall crude oil sales volumes of 4.8 million metric tonnes (MMT) (up 2 percent QoQ but down 5 percent YoY) and natural gas sales volumes to decline 4 percent YoY and one percent QoQ to 4.1 billion cubic meters (BCM) as long-term decline continues for legacy fields, and ramp-up continues to see a delay in KG-98/2 block&rdquo;, the brokerage said in its report. &ldquo;We model gross crude price realization of $85 per barrel (-11 percent QoQ) and net oil price realization (post royalty, windfall tax and cess) of $ 46 per barrel (-1 percent QoQ)&rdquo;.  It forecasts a PAT of Rs 12,002 crore, a 37 percent mYoY growth and a 6.4 percent sequential decline.  EBITDA margin at 52.7 percent is seen declining by 337 bps on year but on a sequential basis, there is an improvement of 362 bps.  Motilal Oswal Financial Services  The brokerage sees a 37.6 percent YoY increase in revenue to Rs 39,168 crore and estimates an EBITDA of Rs 19,551 crore at a YoY growth of 22.4 percent and a sequential growth of 4 percent.  PAT at Rs 11,345 crore is a growth of 29.5 percent compared to the same period last year but it has declined 11.5 percent over the preceding quarter.  The analysts at the brokerage expect, &ldquo;net realization (before windfall tax) to grow 17 percent YoY but decrease 7 percent QoQ, in line with Brent movement. Expect oil sales at -5 percent YoY and +1 percent QoQ, with gas sales at -5 percent YoY and -2 percent QoQ. Value added product sales to decline 13 percent YoY.&rdquo;  Production from the KG Basin remains crucial. Its completion stood at 76 percent in Oct&rsquo;22 and first oil is expected in May&rsquo;23.  ONGC closed Rs 1.45 higher at Rs 148.15 on February 13 at The National Stock Exchange.

Analysts at Motilal Oswal expect to see another 15-20 percent of &lsquo;value upside&rsquo; left in both these stocks as investor attention for both stocks will move to&nbsp;&amp;quot;assessing volume growth scenarios, analysing operating costs and the strength and visibility of the exploration and development pipeline&amp;quot; instead of valuation.

Follow our market blog for live updates  According to the report,&nbsp; Indian upstream stocks like ONGC and Oil India have &amp;quot;proven to be strong value plays in recent months&amp;quot; with both ONGC and Oil India trading higher as a result of&nbsp; robust production growth guidance. Over the last one year, ONGC stocks have gained around 77 percent, while Oil India has gained nearly 2x.  Analysts at Motilal Oswal expect to see another 15-20 percent of &lsquo;value upside&rsquo; left in both these stocks as investor attention for both stocks will move to&nbsp;&amp;quot;assessing volume growth scenarios, analysing operating costs and the strength and visibility of the exploration and development pipeline&amp;quot; instead of valuation. This could lead to some rerating.  Also read:&nbsp;India exported $6.65 billion oil products derived from Russian oil to sanctioning nations: Report  While Motilal Oswal is positive on both the stocks, analysts prefer Oil India to ONGC due to its &amp;quot;exposure to the refining upcycle led by its stake in Numaligarh Refinery Limited, and higher core oil and gas volume growth&amp;quot;.

Meanwhile, ONGC&rsquo;s total oil production in the first nine months of FY24 declined 2.9 percent.

ONGC may face a decline of 0.5&nbsp;percent in crude and 1.4&nbsp;percent in gas production, coupled with a 2&nbsp;percent drop in net crude realisation, leading to a projected 9&nbsp;percent EBITDA&nbsp;loss over the previous quarter.

The stock scaled a fresh record high of Rs 2,905, taking the market capitalisation to Rs 19.5 lakh crore","The Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) single-handedly contributed to a 38 percent surge in the Nifty 50 market capitalisation on January 29. Apart from strong fundamentals, analysts also attributed the rally to foreign funds taking refuge in Reliance Industries to hedge their short positions on the index.  RIL market&nbsp;cap increased around Rs 1.29 lakh crore on January 29.&nbsp;The stock scaled&nbsp;a fresh record high of Rs 2,905, taking the&nbsp;market capitalisation to Rs 19.5 lakh crore.  The next five stocks - ONGC, Adani Enterprises, Larsen &amp;amp;amp; Toubro, HDFC Bank and Coal India - together contributed over 26 percent to the up-move.  Both the benchmarks Sensex and Nifty jumped over 1.7 percent each on January 29.

Also Read:&nbsp;Budget and Markets: Will the FM spook the F&amp;amp;amp;O party by hiking securities transaction tax?  What led to the RIL rally?  According to Shrikant Chouhan of&nbsp;Kotak Securities, Reliance's unexpected surge, a rare occurrence, is notable. &amp;quot;Such moves usually follow when there are numerous short positions in the overall market, and FIIs look for strong stocks to hedge their positions,&amp;quot; he said.  This trend has been observed in the past with stocks&nbsp;like Infosys, Bajaj Finance, and HDFC Bank, he said.  If we look at the derivatives data, Ruchit Jain, Lead Research, 5paisa.com noted that FIIs had last week rolled over their short bets in the index futures with short positions at 78 percent and net short contracts over 1.08 lakh contracts.  &amp;quot;These positions are seen as short heavy and such short heavy positions around the support usually leads to a short covering move,&amp;quot; he said.

Independent analyst Prakash Diwan also said that the recent surge in Singapore GRMs (gross refining margins) indicates a positive outlook for RIL's O2C business.  &amp;quot;This marks a valuation reset for RIL, which is currently under-owned by FIIs. As FIIs sell&nbsp;HDFC Bank, IT and FMCG stocks due to bleak outlook, they will redirect funds elsewhere. And, RIL will be a big beneficiary,&amp;quot; he said.  Also Read:&nbsp;India sees biggest FII outflows in January among Asian markets  RIL stock has seen a nearly 12 percent increase in January, fuelled by positive remarks on capped expenditures and robust retail performance in its Q3 earnings. The company's Q3 capital expenditure (capex) dropped by 22&nbsp;percent sequentially to Rs 30,100 crore, attributed to reduced spending by Jio after the 5G rollout and limited retail space expansion.  Despite a slight increase in net debt, analysts anticipate a positive trend driven by reduced capex and an improved EBITDA run rate, signaling positive free cash flow for the next two years.

The loan will strengthen ONGC Videsh's available cash as it contends with shrinking free cash.  Merchant bankers said last month that the company was likely to issue bonds to raise funds, and Venezuela provided some respite in January by agreeing to give ONGC Videsh some oil in lieu of $600 million dividend dues.  ONGC Videsh's free cash flow was down about 88% from a year earlier to 6.48 billion rupees ($78 million) in the financial year ended March 2023, as per LSEG data.  The new loan is a refinancing of a $500 million loan it had received in 2019 for a project in Mozambique, the spokesperson told Reuters.  DBS Bank, a unit of Singapore's DBS Group Holdings, is leading the syndicated transaction guaranteed by ONGC, spokespersons for both ONGC Videsh and DBS Bank told Reuters.  A syndicated loan involves two or more lenders providing funds for a single loan to a borrower. DBS Bank is committing $300 million for loan while the Indian state-owned Bank of Baroda is providing $120 million, the spokespersons said.  Bank of Baroda did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.  The news was first reported by the Economic Times.","Business, Companies","business,companies,Oil and Natural Gas Corp,DBS Bank, Bank of Baroda",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-arm-gets-36420-million-loandbs-bank-bankbaroda_17404491.html
2024-01-08T10:16:38+05:30,ONGC,PTI,ONGC starts oil production from delayed $5 billion deep-water project,ONGC has started producing from the Cluster-2 project in KG-DWN-98/2 block and will slowly ramp up output.,"State-controlled Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has started oil production from its much-delayed flagship deep-sea project in Krishna Godavari basin in Bay of Bengal, helping reverse years of decline in output, the company said.  ONGC has started producing from the Cluster-2 project in KG-DWN-98/2 block and will slowly ramp up output.  Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said &amp;quot;first oil production commences from complex and difficult&amp;quot; block.  He did not indicate the current output but said &amp;quot;production is expected to be 45,000 barrels per day and over 10 million standard cubic metres per day of gas&amp;quot;.  Cluster-2 oil production should have begun by November 2021 but was delayed because of the Covid pandemic.  ONGC has hired floating vessel Armada Sterling-V, owned 70 per cent by SPOG (Shapoorji Pallonji Oil &amp;amp;amp; Gas) and 30 per cent by Malaysia's Bumi Armada, for producing oil from below seabed.  The FPSO (floating production, storage and offloading vessel), Armada Sterling-V, has been waiting to receive oil since January 2, 2023, after she was hooked up on December 27, 2022.  ONGC previously set May 2023 as the first Cluster-2 oil deadline, extended to August 2023, September 2023, October 2023 and finally December 2023.  ONGC's KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5 block, which sits next to Reliance Industries' KG-D6 block in the KG basin, has a number of discoveries that have been clubbed into clusters. It is situated offshore the Godavari river delta in the Bay of Bengal.  It is located 35 kilometres off the coast of Andhra Pradesh in water depths ranging from 300-3,200 metres. The discoveries in the block are divided into three clusters -- Cluster-1, 2 and 3. Cluster 2 is being put to production first.  Cluster 2 field is divided into two blocks namely 2A and 2B, which as per the original investment decision were expected to produce 23.52 million metric tonnes of oil and 50.70 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas over the life of the field.  Cluster 2A was estimated to contain reserves of 94.26 million tonnes of crude oil and 21.75 bcm of associated gas, while Cluster 2B is estimated to host 51.98 bcm of gas reserves.  Cluster 2A was anticipated to produce 77,305 barrels of oil per day (bopd) and associated gas at a rate of 3.81 million metric standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd) over 15 years.  Cluster 2B is expected to produce free gas of 12.75 mmscmd from eight wells and has a 16-year life. But now the output estimate is lower -- 45,000 bpd of oil and associated gas up to 2.5 mmscmd from Cluster 2A and around 9 mmscmd from Cluster 2B.","Business, Companies","business,companies,ONGC,Oil",https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ongc-starts-oil-productiondelayed-365-billion-deep-water-project_17391231.html
